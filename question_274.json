  "question": "A company runs an application on Amazon EC2 instances. The company needs to implement a disaster recovery (DR) solution for the application. The DR solution needs to have a recovery time objective (RTO) of less than 4 hours. The DR solution also needs to use the fewest possible AWS resources during normal operations.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements in the MOST operationally efficient way?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Create Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) to back up the EC2 instances. Copy the AMIs to a secondary AWS Region. Automate infrastructure deployment in the secondary Region by using AWS Lambda and custom scripts.",
    "B": "Create Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) to back up the EC2 instances. Copy the AMIs to a secondary AWS Region. Automate infrastructure deployment in the secondary Region by using AWS CloudFormation.",
    "C": "Launch EC2 instances in a secondary AWS Region. Keep the EC2 instances in the secondary Region active at all times.",
    "D": "Launch EC2 instances in a secondary Availability Zone. Keep the EC2 instances in the secondary Availability Zone active at all times."
  },
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": "This is a pilot light DR strategy using AMIs and CloudFormation for automated deployment. CloudFormation is more operationally efficient than custom Lambda scripts for infrastructure deployment. AMIs in DR region use minimal resources during normal operations. Active instances in DR region waste resources. Secondary AZ is not a DR solution - DR requires a different region."
