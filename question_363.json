  "question": "A company wants to migrate an on-premises data center to AWS. The data center hosts a storage server that stores data in an NFS-based file system. The storage server holds 200 GB of data. The company needs to migrate the data without interruption to existing services. Multiple resources in AWS must be able to access the data by using the NFS protocol.\n\nWhich combination of steps will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead? (Choose two.)",
  "options": {
    "A": "Create an Amazon FSx for Lustre file system.",
    "B": "Create an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file system.",
    "C": "Create an Amazon S3 bucket to receive the data.",
    "D": "Manually use an operating system copy command to push the data into the AWS destination.",
    "E": "Install an AWS DataSync agent in the on-premises data center."
  },
  "correct_answer": ["B", "E"],
  "explanation": "EFS supports NFS protocol natively and can be accessed by multiple AWS resources. DataSync agent enables efficient data migration with minimal interruption. FSx for Lustre uses Lustre protocol, not NFS. S3 doesn't support NFS protocol natively. Manual copy has higher operational overhead than DataSync."
