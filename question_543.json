  "question": "A company runs Amazon EC2 instances in multiple AWS accounts that are individually billed. The company recently purchased a Savings Plan. Because of changes in the company's business requirements, the company has decommissioned a large number of EC2 instances. The company wants to use its Savings Plan discounts on its other AWS accounts.\n\nWhich combination of steps will meet these requirements? (Choose two.)",
  "options": {
    "A": "From the AWS Account Management Console of the management account, turn on discount sharing from the billing preferences section.",
    "B": "From the AWS Account Management Console of the account that purchased the existing Savings Plan, turn on discount sharing from the billing preferences section. Include all accounts.",
    "C": "From the AWS Organizations management account, use AWS Resource Access Manager (AWS RAM) to share the Savings Plan with other accounts.",
    "D": "Create an organization in AWS Organizations in a new payer account. Invite the other AWS accounts to join the organization from the management account.",
    "E": "Create an organization in AWS Organizations in the existing AWS account with the existing EC2 instances and Savings Plan. Invite the other AWS accounts to join the organization from the management account."
  },
  "correct_answer": ["A", "D"],
  "explanation": "To share Savings Plan benefits across accounts, the accounts must be in the same Organization. Create an Organization with a new management/payer account (D). Enable discount sharing from the management account's billing preferences (A). This allows Savings Plan benefits to apply across all member accounts."
