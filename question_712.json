  "question": "A company is designing a web application on AWS. The application will use a VPN connection between the company's existing data centers and the company's VPCs.\n\nThe company uses Amazon Route 53 as its DNS service. The application must use private DNS records to communicate with the on-premises services from a VPC.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements in the MOST secure manner?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Create a Route 53 Resolver outbound endpoint. Create a resolver rule. Associate the resolver rule with the VPC.",
    "B": "Create a Route 53 Resolver inbound endpoint. Create a resolver rule. Associate the resolver rule with the VPC.",
    "C": "Create a Route 53 private hosted zone. Associate the private hosted zone with the VPC.",
    "D": "Create a Route 53 public hosted zone. Create a record for each service to allow service communication"
  },
  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": "Route 53 Resolver outbound endpoints allow DNS queries from VPC resources to be forwarded to on-premises DNS servers. This enables the VPC to resolve private DNS records for on-premises services through the VPN connection securely."
