  "question": "A development team has launched a new application that is hosted on Amazon EC2 instances inside a development VPC. A solutions architect needs to create a new VPC in the same account. The new VPC will be peered with the development VPC. The VPC CIDR block for the development VPC is 192.168.0.0/24. The solutions architect needs to create a CIDR block for the new VPC. The CIDR block must be valid for a VPC peering connection to the development VPC.\n\nWhat is the SMALLEST CIDR block that meets these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "10.0.1.0/32",
    "B": "192.168.0.0/24",
    "C": "192.168.1.0/32",
    "D": "10.0.1.0/24"
  },
  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": "VPC peering requires non-overlapping CIDR blocks. 192.168.0.0/24 overlaps with the development VPC. /32 is not a valid VPC CIDR (minimum is /28, maximum is /16). 10.0.1.0/24 is non-overlapping and is the smallest valid VPC CIDR among the options. A /24 provides 256 IP addresses and is valid for AWS VPC."
