  "question": "A company has developed a new video game as a web application. The application is in a three-tier architecture in a VPC with Amazon RDS for MySQL in the database layer. Several players will compete concurrently online. The game's developers want to display a top-10 scoreboard in near-real time and offer the ability to stop and restore the game while preserving the current scores.\n\nWhat should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Set up an Amazon ElastiCache for Memcached cluster to cache the scores for the web application to display.",
    "B": "Set up an Amazon ElastiCache for Redis cluster to compute and cache the scores for the web application to display.",
    "C": "Place an Amazon CloudFront distribution in front of the web application to cache the scoreboard in a section of the application.",
    "D": "Create a read replica on Amazon RDS for MySQL to run queries to compute the scoreboard and serve the read traffic to the web application."
  },
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": "ElastiCache for Redis supports sorted sets, ideal for leaderboards. Redis provides data persistence (can stop/restore with scores preserved) and near-real-time performance. Memcached doesn't persist data and lacks sorted set functionality. CloudFront caches static content, not dynamic scoreboards. Read replica adds database overhead for real-time leaderboard updates."
