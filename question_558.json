  "question": "A company has two VPCs that are located in the us-west-2 Region within the same AWS account. The company needs to allow network traffic between these VPCs. Approximately 500 GB of data transfer will occur between the VPCs each month.\n\nWhat is the MOST cost-effective solution to connect these VPCs?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Implement AWS Transit Gateway to connect the VPCs. Update the route tables of each VPC to use the transit gateway for inter-VPC communication.",
    "B": "Implement an AWS Site-to-Site VPN tunnel between the VPCs. Update the route tables of each VPC to use the VPN tunnel for inter-VPC communication.",
    "C": "Set up a VPC peering connection between the VPCs. Update the route tables of each VPC to use the VPC peering connection for inter-VPC communication.",
    "D": "Set up a 1 GB AWS Direct Connect connection between the VPCs. Update the route tables of each VPC to use the Direct Connect connection for inter-VPC communication."
  },
  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": "VPC peering is the most cost-effective solution for connecting two VPCs in the same region. There is no hourly charge for VPC peering, only data transfer charges. Transit Gateway has hourly charges and is better suited for connecting many VPCs."
