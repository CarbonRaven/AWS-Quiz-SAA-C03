  "question": "A company wants to use the AWS Cloud to improve its on-premises disaster recovery (DR) configuration. The company's core production business application uses Microsoft SQL Server Standard, which runs on a virtual machine (VM). The application has a recovery point objective (RPO) of 30 seconds or fewer and a recovery time objective (RTO) of 60 minutes. The DR solution needs to minimize costs wherever possible.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Configure a multi-site active/active setup between the on-premises server and AWS by using Microsoft SQL Server Enterprise with Always On availability groups.",
    "B": "Configure a warm standby Amazon RDS for SQL Server database on AWS. Configure AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) to use change data capture (CDC).",
    "C": "Use AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery configured to replicate disk changes to AWS as a pilot light.",
    "D": "Use third-party backup software to capture backups every night. Store a secondary set of backups in Amazon S3."
  },
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": "DMS with CDC provides continuous replication with near-zero RPO, meeting the 30-second RPO requirement. RDS warm standby can be started within the 60-minute RTO. This is more cost-effective than multi-site active/active. Elastic Disaster Recovery is for full VM replication. Nightly backups don't meet the RPO."
}
