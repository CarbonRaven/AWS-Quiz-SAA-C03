  "question": "A company recently signed a contract with an AWS Managed Service Provider (MSP) Partner for help with an application migration initiative. A solutions architect needs to share an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) from an existing AWS account with the MSP Partner's AWS account. The AMI is backed by Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) and uses a customer managed AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key to encrypt EBS volume snapshots.\n\nWhat is the MOST secure way to share the AMI with the MSP Partner's AWS account?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Make the encrypted AMI and snapshots publicly available. Modify the key policy to allow the MSP Partner's AWS account to use the key.",
    "B": "Modify the launchPermission property of the AMI. Share the AMI with the MSP Partner's AWS account only. Modify the key policy to allow the MSP Partner's AWS account to use the key.",
    "C": "Modify the launchPermission property of the AMI. Share the AMI with the MSP Partner's AWS account only. Modify the key policy to trust a new KMS key that is owned by the MSP Partner for encryption.",
    "D": "Export the AMI from the source account to an Amazon S3 bucket in the MSP Partner's AWS account. Encrypt the S3 bucket with a new KMS key that is owned by the MSP Partner. Copy and launch the AMI in the MSP Partner's AWS account."
  },
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": "Modifying launchPermission to share only with specific accounts is secure and targeted. Granting KMS key usage permission allows the partner to decrypt and launch the AMI. Making AMI public is not secure. Creating a new KMS key isn't necessary. Exporting to S3 adds unnecessary complexity."
