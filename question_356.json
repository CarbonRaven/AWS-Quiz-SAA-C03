  "question": "A company stores its data objects in Amazon S3 Standard storage. A solutions architect has found that 75% of the data is rarely accessed after 30 days. The company needs all the data to remain immediately accessible with the same high availability and resiliency, but the company wants to minimize storage costs.\n\nWhich storage solution will meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Move the data objects to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 30 days.",
    "B": "Move the data objects to S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) after 30 days.",
    "C": "Move the data objects to S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA) after 30 days.",
    "D": "Move the data objects to S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA) immediately."
  },
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": "S3 Standard-IA provides immediate access with the same high availability (99.9%) and durability as Standard but at lower cost for infrequent access. Glacier Deep Archive isn't immediately accessible. One Zone-IA has lower availability (99.5%) and resiliency (single AZ), not meeting the same HA requirement."
