  "question": "A solutions architect needs to design the architecture for an application that a vendor provides as a Docker container image. The container needs 50 GB of storage available for temporary files. The infrastructure must be serverless.\n\nWhich solution meets these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Create an AWS Lambda function that uses the Docker container image with an Amazon S3 mounted volume that has more than 50 GB of space.",
    "B": "Create an AWS Lambda function that uses the Docker container image with an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume that has more than 50 GB of space.",
    "C": "Create an Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) cluster that uses the AWS Fargate launch type. Create a task definition for the container image with an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) volume. Create a service with that task definition.",
    "D": "Create an Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) cluster that uses the Amazon EC2 launch type with an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume that has more than 50 GB of space. Create a task definition for the container image. Create a service with that task definition."
  },
  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": "AWS Fargate is serverless and eliminates the need to manage infrastructure. EFS can be mounted to Fargate tasks to provide persistent storage greater than 50 GB. Lambda has ephemeral storage limits (up to 10 GB) and cannot mount S3 or EBS directly. EC2 launch type is not serverless."
