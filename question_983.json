  "question": "A company hosts its core network services, including directory services and DNS, in its on-premises data center. The data center is connected to the AWS Cloud using AWS Direct Connect (DX). Additional AWS accounts are planned that will require quick, cost-effective, and consistent access to these network services.\n\nWhat should a solutions architect implement to meet these requirements with the LEAST amount of operational overhead?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Create a DX connection in each new account. Route the network traffic to the on-premises servers.",
    "B": "Configure VPC endpoints in the DX VPC for all required services. Route the network traffic to the on-premises servers.",
    "C": "Create a VPN connection between each new account and the DX VPC. Route the network traffic to the on-premises servers.",
    "D": "Configure AWS Transit Gateway between the accounts. Assign DX to the transit gateway and route network traffic to the on-premises servers."
  },
  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": "Transit Gateway provides a hub-and-spoke model that connects multiple VPCs and on-premises networks through a single gateway. Attaching Direct Connect to Transit Gateway allows all accounts to access on-premises services through one DX connection with minimal operational overhead."
