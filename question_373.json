  "question": "A company observes an increase in Amazon EC2 costs in its most recent bill. The billing team notices unwanted vertical scaling of instance types for a couple of Amazon EC2 instances. A solutions architect needs to create a graph comparing the last 2 months of EC2 costs. The information should be presented visually.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Use AWS Budgets to create a budget report and compare EC2 costs based on instance types.",
    "B": "Use Cost Explorer's granular filtering feature to perform an in-depth analysis of EC2 costs based on instance types.",
    "C": "Use graphs from the AWS Billing and Cost Management dashboard to compare EC2 costs based on instance types for the last 2 months.",
    "D": "Use AWS Cost and Usage Reports to create a report and send it to an Amazon S3 bucket. Use Amazon QuickSight with Amazon S3 as a source to generate an interactive graph based on instance types."
  },
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": "Cost Explorer provides visual graphs and granular filtering to analyze costs by instance type, service, region, and time period. It's designed for exactly this use case. AWS Budgets is for setting alerts, not detailed analysis. Cost and Usage Reports with QuickSight adds unnecessary complexity. The Billing dashboard has limited filtering capabilities."
