  "question": "A company's application runs on Amazon EC2 instances that are in multiple Availability Zones. The application needs to ingest real-time data from third-party applications.\n\nThe company needs a data ingestion solution that places the ingested raw data in an Amazon S3 bucket.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Create Amazon Kinesis data streams for data ingestion. Create Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery streams to consume the Kinesis data streams. Specify the S3 bucket as the destination of the delivery streams.",
    "B": "Create database migration tasks in AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS). Specify replication instances of the EC2 instances as the source endpoints. Specify the S3 bucket as the target endpoint. Set the migration type to migrate existing data and replicate ongoing changes.",
    "C": "Create and configure AWS DataSync agents on the EC2 instances. Configure DataSync tasks to transfer data from the EC2 instances to the S3 bucket.",
    "D": "Create an AWS Direct Connect connection to the application for data ingestion. Create Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery streams to consume direct PUT operations from the application. Specify the S3 bucket as the destination of the delivery streams."
  },
  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": "Amazon Kinesis Data Streams handles real-time data ingestion, and Kinesis Data Firehose delivers the data to S3. This is the standard architecture for real-time data ingestion with S3 as the destination."
}
