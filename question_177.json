  "question": "An entertainment company is using Amazon DynamoDB to store media metadata. The application is read intensive and experiencing delays. The company does not have staff to handle additional operational overhead and needs to improve the performance efficiency of DynamoDB without reconfiguring the application.\nWhich solution meets this requirement?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Use Amazon ElastiCache for Redis.",
    "B": "Use Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX).",
    "C": "Replicate data by using DynamoDB global tables.",
    "D": "Use Amazon ElastiCache for Memcached with Auto Discovery enabled."
  },
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": "DAX is a fully managed, in-memory cache specifically designed for DynamoDB. It requires minimal application changes (just endpoint configuration) and provides microsecond read latency. ElastiCache would require application code changes to implement caching logic."
}
