  "question": "A company has two VPCs named Management and Production. The Management VPC uses VPNs through a customer gateway to connect to a single device in the data center. The Production VPC uses a virtual private gateway with two attached AWS Direct Connect connections. The Management and Production VPCs both use a single VPC peering connection to allow communication between the applications.\n\nWhat should a solutions architect do to mitigate any single point of failure in this architecture?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Add a set of VPNs between the Management and Production VPCs.",
    "B": "Add a second virtual private gateway and attach it to the Management VPC.",
    "C": "Add a second set of VPNs to the Management VPC from a second customer gateway device.",
    "D": "Add a second VPC peering connection between the Management VPC and the Production VPC."
  },
  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": "The single customer gateway device is a single point of failure for the Management VPC's VPN connection. Adding a second customer gateway device with redundant VPN tunnels eliminates this SPOF. VPN between VPCs doesn't address the data center connectivity SPOF. A VPC can only have one virtual private gateway. VPC peering doesn't have a redundancy option (it's already highly available)."
