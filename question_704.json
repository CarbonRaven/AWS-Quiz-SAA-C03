  "question": "An online video game company must maintain ultra-low latency for its game servers. The game servers run on Amazon EC2 instances. The company needs a solution that can handle millions of UDP internet traffic requests each second.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Configure an Application Load Balancer with the required protocol and ports for the internet traffic. Specify the EC2 instances as the targets.",
    "B": "Configure a Gateway Load Balancer for the internet traffic. Specify the EC2 instances as the targets.",
    "C": "Configure a Network Load Balancer with the required protocol and ports for the internet traffic. Specify the EC2 instances as the targets.",
    "D": "Launch an identical set of game servers on EC2 instances in separate AWS Regions. Route internet traffic to both sets of EC2 instances."
  },
  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": "Network Load Balancer (NLB) supports UDP traffic, provides ultra-low latency, and can handle millions of requests per second. ALB only supports HTTP/HTTPS (not UDP), Gateway Load Balancer is for third-party virtual appliances, and launching in multiple regions is not cost-effective."
