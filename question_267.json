  "question": "A company has one million users that use its mobile app. The company must analyze the data usage in near-real time. The company also must encrypt the data in near-real time and must store the data in a centralized location in Apache Parquet format for further processing.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Create an Amazon Kinesis data stream to store the data in Amazon S3. Create an Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics application to analyze the data. Invoke an AWS Lambda function to send the data to the Kinesis Data Analytics application.",
    "B": "Create an Amazon Kinesis data stream to store the data in Amazon S3. Create an Amazon EMR cluster to analyze the data. Invoke an AWS Lambda function to send the data to the EMR cluster.",
    "C": "Create an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream to store the data in Amazon S3. Create an Amazon EMR cluster to analyze the data.",
    "D": "Create an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream to store the data in Amazon S3. Create an Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics application to analyze the data."
  },
  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": "Kinesis Data Firehose automatically handles encryption, format conversion to Parquet, and delivery to S3 with minimal operational overhead. Kinesis Data Analytics provides near-real-time analysis. Both are fully managed services. EMR clusters require more operational management. Kinesis Data Streams requires more configuration for S3 delivery compared to Firehose."
