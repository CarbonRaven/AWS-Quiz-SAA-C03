  "question": "A company's compliance team needs to move its file shares to AWS. The shares run on a Windows Server SMB file share. A self-managed on-premises Active Directory controls access to the files and folders.\n\nThe company wants to use Amazon FSx for Windows File Server as part of the solution. The company must ensure that the on-premises Active Directory groups restrict access to the FSx for Windows File Server SMB compliance shares, folders, and files after the move to AWS. The company has created an FSx for Windows File Server file system.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Create an Active Directory Connector to connect to the Active Directory. Map the Active Directory groups to IAM groups to restrict access.",
    "B": "Assign a tag with a Restrict tag key and a Compliance tag value. Map the Active Directory groups to IAM groups to restrict access.",
    "C": "Create an IAM service-linked role that is linked directly to FSx for Windows File Server to restrict access.",
    "D": "Join the file system to the Active Directory to restrict access."
  },
  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": "FSx for Windows File Server can be joined directly to an on-premises Active Directory, allowing existing AD groups and permissions to control access to files and folders. This maintains the same access control model. IAM groups don't map to AD groups for file-level permissions. Tags and service-linked roles don't provide file/folder level access control."
