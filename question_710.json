  "question": "A company's website hosted on Amazon EC2 instances processes classified data stored in Amazon S3. Due to security concerns, the company requires a private and secure connection between its EC2 resources and Amazon S3.\n\nWhich solution meets these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Set up S3 bucket policies to allow access from a VPC endpoint.",
    "B": "Set up an IAM policy to grant read-write access to the S3 bucket.",
    "C": "Set up a NAT gateway to access resources outside the private subnet.",
    "D": "Set up an access key ID and a secret access key to access the S3 bucket."
  },
  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": "A VPC endpoint for S3 (Gateway endpoint) allows private connectivity between EC2 instances and S3 without traversing the public internet. S3 bucket policies can be configured to allow access only from the VPC endpoint, ensuring a private and secure connection."
