  "question": "A company has created an image analysis application in which users can upload photos and add photo frames to their images. The users upload images and metadata to indicate which photo frames they want to add to their images. The application uses a single Amazon EC2 instance and Amazon DynamoDB to store the metadata.\nThe application is becoming more popular, and the number of users is increasing. The company expects the number of concurrent users to vary significantly depending on the time of day and day of week. The company must ensure that the application can scale to meet the needs of the growing user base.\nWhich solution meets these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Use AWS Lambda to process the photos. Store the photos and metadata in DynamoDB.",
    "B": "Use Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose to process the photos and to store the photos and metadata.",
    "C": "Use AWS Lambda to process the photos. Store the photos in Amazon S3. Retain DynamoDB to store the metadata.",
    "D": "Increase the number of EC2 instances to three. Use Provisioned IOPS SSD (io2) Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes to store the photos and metadata."
  },
  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": "Lambda scales automatically for variable concurrent users. S3 is ideal for storing photos (images). DynamoDB already handles metadata well and scales automatically. This is the most scalable architecture."
}
