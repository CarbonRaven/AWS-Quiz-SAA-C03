  "question": "A company has an ecommerce checkout workflow that writes an order to a database and calls a service to process the payment. Users are experiencing timeouts during the checkout process. When users resubmit the checkout form, multiple unique orders are created for the same desired transaction.\n\nHow should a solutions architect refactor this workflow to prevent the creation of multiple orders?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Configure the web application to send an order message to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose. Set the payment service to retrieve the message from Kinesis Data Firehose and process the order.",
    "B": "Create a rule in AWS CloudTrail to invoke an AWS Lambda function based on the logged application path request. Use Lambda to query the database, call the payment service, and pass in the order information.",
    "C": "Store the order in the database. Send a message that includes the order number to Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS). Set the payment service to poll Amazon SNS, retrieve the message, and process the order.",
    "D": "Store the order in the database. Send a message that includes the order number to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) FIFO queue. Set the payment service to retrieve the message and process the order. Delete the message from the queue."
  },
  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": "SQS FIFO queues provide exactly-once processing and message deduplication, preventing duplicate orders. The order is stored first, then processed asynchronously via the queue. FIFO ensures ordering and deduplication. Kinesis Firehose is for data streaming, not transactional workflows. SNS is pub/sub and doesn't prevent duplicates. CloudTrail is for auditing, not application workflows."
