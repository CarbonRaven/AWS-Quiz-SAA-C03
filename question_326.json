  "question": "An image hosting company uploads its large assets to Amazon S3 Standard buckets. The company uses multipart upload in parallel by using S3 APIs and overwrites if the same object is uploaded again. For the first 30 days after upload, the objects will be accessed frequently. The objects will be used less frequently after 30 days, but the access patterns for each object will be inconsistent. The company must optimize its S3 storage costs while maintaining high availability and resiliency of stored assets.\n\nWhich combination of actions should a solutions architect recommend to meet these requirements? (Choose two.)",
  "options": {
    "A": "Move assets to S3 Intelligent-Tiering after 30 days.",
    "B": "Configure an S3 Lifecycle policy to clean up incomplete multipart uploads.",
    "C": "Configure an S3 Lifecycle policy to clean up expired object delete markers.",
    "D": "Move assets to S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) after 30 days.",
    "E": "Move assets to S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA) after 30 days."
  },
  "correct_answer": ["A", "B"],
  "explanation": "S3 Intelligent-Tiering (A) automatically optimizes costs for unpredictable access patterns after 30 days. Cleaning up incomplete multipart uploads (B) removes partial uploads that waste storage. S3 Standard-IA has retrieval fees for inconsistent access. One Zone-IA reduces resiliency. Delete markers are irrelevant since objects are overwritten."
