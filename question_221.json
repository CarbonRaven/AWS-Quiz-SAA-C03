  "question": "A company runs an application on a group of Amazon Linux EC2 instances. For compliance reasons, the company must retain all application log files for 7 years. The log files will be analyzed by a reporting tool that must be able to access all the files concurrently.\nWhich storage solution meets these requirements MOST cost-effectively?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS)",
    "B": "Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS)",
    "C": "Amazon EC2 instance store",
    "D": "Amazon S3"
  },
  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": "S3 is the most cost-effective for long-term log storage (7 years). It provides concurrent access to all files and can use lifecycle policies for further cost optimization. EBS is more expensive and not designed for long-term archival. Instance store is ephemeral."
