  "question": "A company runs a web application on Amazon EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group that has a target group. The company designed the application to work with session affinity (sticky sessions) for a better user experience.\n\nThe application must be available publicly over the internet as an endpoint. A WAF must be applied to the endpoint for additional security. Session affinity (sticky sessions) must be configured on the endpoint.\n\nWhich combination of steps will meet these requirements? (Choose two.)",
  "options": {
    "A": "Create a public Network Load Balancer. Specify the application target group.",
    "B": "Create a Gateway Load Balancer. Specify the application target group.",
    "C": "Create a public Application Load Balancer. Specify the application target group.",
    "D": "Create a second target group. Add Elastic IP addresses to the EC2 instances.",
    "E": "Create a web ACL in AWS WAF. Associate the web ACL with the endpoint"
  },
  "correct_answer": ["C", "E"],
  "explanation": "Application Load Balancer supports sticky sessions and can be integrated with AWS WAF. AWS WAF web ACLs can be associated with ALB to provide web application firewall protection. NLB does not support WAF integration or sticky sessions."
