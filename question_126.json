  "question": "A solutions architect needs to implement a solution to reduce a company's storage costs. All the company's data is in the Amazon S3 Standard storage class. The company must keep all data for at least 25 years. Data from the most recent 2 years must be highly available and immediately retrievable.\nWhich solution will meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Set up an S3 Lifecycle policy to transition objects to S3 Glacier Deep Archive immediately.",
    "B": "Set up an S3 Lifecycle policy to transition objects to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 2 years.",
    "C": "Use S3 Intelligent-Tiering. Activate the archiving option to ensure that data is archived in S3 Glacier Deep Archive.",
    "D": "Set up an S3 Lifecycle policy to transition objects to S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA) immediately and to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 2 years."
  },
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": "Data must be highly available and immediately retrievable for 2 years (S3 Standard), then can be archived. S3 Glacier Deep Archive is the most cost-effective for long-term archival (25 years). A lifecycle policy transitioning after 2 years meets both requirements."
