  "question": "A company needs to grant a team of developers access to the company's AWS resources. The company must maintain a high level of security for the resources.\n\nThe company requires an access control solution that will prevent unauthorized access to the sensitive data.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Share the IAM user credentials for each development team member with the rest of the team to simplify access management and to streamline development workflows.",
    "B": "Define IAM roles that have fine-grained permissions based on the principle of least privilege. Assign an IAM role to each developer.",
    "C": "Create IAM access keys to grant programmatic access to AWS resources. Allow only developers to interact with AWS resources through API calls by using the access keys.",
    "D": "Create an AWS Cognito user pool. Grant developers access to AWS resources by using the user pool."
  },
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": "IAM roles with fine-grained permissions following least privilege provide secure access control. Roles are more secure than shared credentials or long-term access keys."
