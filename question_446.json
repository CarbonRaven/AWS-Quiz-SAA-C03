  "question": "A company stores data in PDF format in an Amazon S3 bucket. The company must follow a legal requirement to retain all new and existing data in Amazon S3 for 7 years.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Turn on the S3 Versioning feature for the S3 bucket. Configure S3 Lifecycle to delete the data after 7 years. Configure multi-factor authentication (MFA) delete for all S3 objects.",
    "B": "Turn on S3 Object Lock with governance retention mode for the S3 bucket. Set the retention period to expire after 7 years. Recopy all existing objects to bring the existing data into compliance.",
    "C": "Turn on S3 Object Lock with compliance retention mode for the S3 bucket. Set the retention period to expire after 7 years. Recopy all existing objects to bring the existing data into compliance.",
    "D": "Turn on S3 Object Lock with compliance retention mode for the S3 bucket. Set the retention period to expire after 7 years. Use S3 Batch Operations to bring the existing data into compliance."
  },
  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": "S3 Object Lock with compliance mode prevents deletion for the retention period (legal requirement). S3 Batch Operations efficiently applies retention to existing objects without manual recopying. Governance mode allows privileged users to delete objects. Versioning with MFA delete doesn't prevent deletion. Manual recopying has high operational overhead compared to Batch Operations."
