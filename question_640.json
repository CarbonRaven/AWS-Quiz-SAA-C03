  "question": "A company has an application workflow that uses an AWS Lambda function to download and decrypt files from Amazon S3. These files are encrypted using AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) keys. A solutions architect needs to design a solution that will ensure the required permissions are set correctly.\n\nWhich combination of actions accomplish this? (Choose two.)",
  "options": {
    "A": "Attach the kms:decrypt permission to the Lambda function's resource policy.",
    "B": "Grant the decrypt permission for the Lambda IAM role in the KMS key's policy.",
    "C": "Grant the decrypt permission for the Lambda resource policy in the KMS key's policy.",
    "D": "Create a new IAM policy with the kms:decrypt permission and attach the policy to the Lambda function.",
    "E": "Create a new IAM role with the kms:decrypt permission and attach the execution role to the Lambda function."
  },
  "correct_answer": ["B", "E"],
  "explanation": "Lambda needs an execution role with kms:decrypt permission to decrypt files. The KMS key policy must also grant decrypt permission to the Lambda's IAM role. Both the IAM role permissions and KMS key policy must be configured for Lambda to decrypt files."
}
