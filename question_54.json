  "question": "A company runs multiple Windows workloads on AWS. The company's employees use Windows file shares that are hosted on two Amazon EC2 instances. The file shares synchronize data between themselves and maintain duplicate copies. The company wants a highly available and durable storage solution that preserves how users currently access the files.\nWhat should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Migrate all the data to Amazon S3. Set up IAM authentication for users to access files.",
    "B": "Set up an Amazon S3 File Gateway. Mount the S3 File Gateway on the existing EC2 instances.",
    "C": "Extend the file share environment to Amazon FSx for Windows File Server with a Multi-AZ configuration. Migrate all the data to FSx for Windows File Server.",
    "D": "Extend the file share environment to Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) with a Multi-AZ configuration. Migrate all the data to Amazon EFS."
  },
  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": "FSx for Windows File Server provides native Windows file system features (SMB protocol, NTFS, Active Directory integration) that preserve existing user access patterns. Multi-AZ provides high availability."
