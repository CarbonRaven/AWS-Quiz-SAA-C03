  "question": "A company is creating a REST API. The company has strict requirements for the use of TLS. The company requires TLSv1.3 on the API endpoints. The company also requires a specific public third-party certificate authority (CA) to sign the TLS certificate.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Use a local machine to create a certificate that is signed by the third-party CA. Import the certificate into AWS Certificate Manager (ACM). Create an HTTP API in Amazon API Gateway with a custom domain. Configure the custom domain to use the certificate.",
    "B": "Create a certificate in AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) that is signed by the third-party CA. Create an HTTP API in Amazon API Gateway with a custom domain. Configure the custom domain to use the certificate.",
    "C": "Use AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) to create a certificate that is signed by the third-party CA. Import the certificate into AWS Certificate Manager (ACM). Create an AWS Lambda function with a Lambda function URL. Configure the Lambda function URL to use the certificate.",
    "D": "Create a certificate in AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) that is signed by the third-party CA. Create an AWS Lambda function with a Lambda function URL. Configure the Lambda function URL to use the certificate."
  },
  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": "ACM can only issue certificates signed by Amazon's CA, not third-party CAs. To use a third-party CA, you must create the certificate externally and import it into ACM. API Gateway HTTP APIs support TLSv1.3 with custom domains."
