  "question": "A package delivery company has an application that uses Amazon EC2 instances and an Amazon Aurora MySQL DB cluster. As the application becomes more popular, EC2 instance usage increases only slightly. DB cluster usage increases at a much faster rate.\n\nThe company adds a read replica, which reduces the DB cluster usage for a short period of time. However, the load continues to increase. The operations that cause the increase in DB cluster usage are all repeated read statements that are related to delivery details. The company needs to alleviate the effect of repeated reads on the DB cluster.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Implement an Amazon ElastiCache for Redis cluster between the application and the DB cluster.",
    "B": "Add an additional read replica to the DB cluster.",
    "C": "Configure Aurora Auto Scaling for the Aurora read replicas.",
    "D": "Modify the DB cluster to have multiple writer instances."
  },
  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": "ElastiCache for Redis caches repeated read queries, significantly reducing database load for frequently accessed delivery details. This is more cost-effective than adding read replicas for repeated reads, as cache hits avoid database queries entirely."
}
