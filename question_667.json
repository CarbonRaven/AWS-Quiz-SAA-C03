  "question": "A company is moving its data and applications to AWS during a multiyear migration project. The company wants to securely access data on Amazon S3 from the company's AWS Region and from the company's on-premises location. The data must not traverse the internet. The company has established an AWS Direct Connect connection between its Region and its on-premises location.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Create gateway endpoints for Amazon S3. Use the gateway endpoints to securely access the data from the Region and the on-premises location.",
    "B": "Create a gateway in AWS Transit Gateway to access Amazon S3 securely from the Region and the on-premises location.",
    "C": "Create interface endpoints for Amazon S3. Use the interface endpoints to securely access the data from the Region and the on-premises location.",
    "D": "Use an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key to access the data securely from the Region and the on-premises location."
  },
  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": "Interface endpoints (PrivateLink) for S3 provide private IP addresses that can be accessed from on-premises through Direct Connect. Gateway endpoints only work from within the VPC and cannot be accessed from on-premises locations over Direct Connect."
