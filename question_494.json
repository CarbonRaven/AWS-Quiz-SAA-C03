  "question": "A company uses Amazon EC2 instances to host its internal systems. As part of a deployment operation, an administrator tries to use the AWS CLI to terminate an EC2 instance. However, the administrator receives a 403 (Access Denied) error message.\n\nThe administrator is using an IAM role that has an IAM policy with an Allow effect for ec2:TerminateInstances with a condition requiring requests to originate from specific CIDR blocks (192.0.2.0/24 or 203.0.113.0/24).\n\nWhat is the cause of the unsuccessful request?",
  "options": {
    "A": "The EC2 instance has a resource-based policy with a Deny statement.",
    "B": "The principal has not been specified in the policy statement.",
    "C": "The \"Action\" field does not grant the actions that are required to terminate the EC2 instance.",
    "D": "The request to terminate the EC2 instance does not originate from the CIDR blocks 192.0.2.0/24 or 203.0.113.0/24."
  },
  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": "The IAM policy has an IpAddress condition that restricts the action to specific source IP CIDR blocks. If the administrator's request originates from an IP address outside these ranges, the condition isn't met and access is denied. EC2 instances don't have resource-based policies."
}
