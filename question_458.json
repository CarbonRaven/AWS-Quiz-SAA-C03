  "question": "A solutions architect is designing a REST API in Amazon API Gateway for a cash payback service. The application requires 1 GB of memory and 2 GB of storage for its computation resources. The application will require that the data is in a relational format.\n\nWhich additional combination of AWS services will meet these requirements with the LEAST administrative effort? (Choose two.)",
  "options": {
    "A": "Amazon EC2",
    "B": "AWS Lambda",
    "C": "Amazon RDS",
    "D": "Amazon DynamoDB",
    "E": "Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Services (Amazon EKS)"
  },
  "correct_answer": ["B", "C"],
  "explanation": "Lambda (B) provides serverless compute with minimal administrative effort and supports up to 10 GB memory. Amazon RDS (C) is a managed relational database service with low administrative overhead. DynamoDB is NoSQL, not relational. EC2 and EKS require more administrative effort."
