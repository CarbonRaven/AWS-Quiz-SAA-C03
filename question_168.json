  "question": "A security team wants to limit access to specific services or actions in all of the team's AWS accounts. All accounts belong to a large organization in AWS Organizations. The solution must be scalable and there must be a single point where permissions can be maintained.\nWhat should a solutions architect do to accomplish this?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Create an ACL to provide access to the services or actions.",
    "B": "Create a security group to allow accounts and attach it to user groups.",
    "C": "Create cross-account roles in each account to deny access to the services or actions.",
    "D": "Create a service control policy in the root organizational unit to deny access to the services or actions."
  },
  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": "Service Control Policies (SCPs) in AWS Organizations provide centralized control over permissions across all accounts. SCPs attached to the root OU apply to all accounts, providing a single point of management. This is scalable and doesn't require per-account configuration."
}
