  "question": "A company runs a web application on multiple Amazon EC2 instances in a VPC. The application needs to write sensitive data to an Amazon S3 bucket. The data cannot be sent over the public internet.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Create a gateway VPC endpoint for Amazon S3. Create a route in the VPC route table to the endpoint.",
    "B": "Create an internal Network Load Balancer that has the S3 bucket as the target.",
    "C": "Deploy the S3 bucket inside the VPC. Create a route in the VPC route table to the bucket.",
    "D": "Create an AWS Direct Connect connection between the VPC and an S3 regional endpoint."
  },
  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": "A gateway VPC endpoint for S3 allows traffic to flow between the VPC and S3 without traversing the public internet. S3 buckets cannot be deployed inside a VPC, and NLB cannot target S3."
}
