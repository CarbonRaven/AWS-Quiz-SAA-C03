  "question": "A company has Amazon EC2 instances that run nightly batch jobs to process data. The EC2 instances run in an Auto Scaling group that uses On-Demand billing. If a job fails on one instance, another instance will reprocess the job. The batch jobs run between 12:00 AM and 06:00 AM local time every day.\n\nWhich solution will provide EC2 instances to meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Purchase a 1-year Savings Plan for Amazon EC2 that covers the instance family of the Auto Scaling group that the batch job uses.",
    "B": "Purchase a 1-year Reserved Instance for the specific instance type and operating system of the instances in the Auto Scaling group that the batch job uses.",
    "C": "Create a new launch template for the Auto Scaling group. Set the instances to Spot Instances. Set a policy to scale out based on CPU usage.",
    "D": "Create a new launch template for the Auto Scaling group. Increase the instance size. Set a policy to scale out based on CPU usage."
  },
  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": "Spot Instances provide up to 90% cost savings compared to On-Demand. Since jobs can be reprocessed if an instance is interrupted, the workload is fault-tolerant and ideal for Spot. Batch jobs running only 6 hours/day don't justify Reserved Instances or Savings Plans."
