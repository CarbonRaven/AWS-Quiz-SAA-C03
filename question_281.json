  "question": "A company runs a fleet of web servers using an Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance. After a routine compliance check, the company sets a standard that requires a recovery point objective (RPO) of less than 1 second for all its production databases.\n\nWhich solution meets these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Enable a Multi-AZ deployment for the DB instance.",
    "B": "Enable auto scaling for the DB instance in one Availability Zone.",
    "C": "Configure the DB instance in one Availability Zone, and create multiple read replicas in a separate Availability Zone.",
    "D": "Configure the DB instance in one Availability Zone, and configure AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) change data capture (CDC) tasks."
  },
  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": "RDS Multi-AZ uses synchronous replication to a standby instance, providing an RPO of effectively zero (less than 1 second). The standby is always in sync with the primary. Read replicas use asynchronous replication with potential lag. DMS CDC is for migration/replication to other targets, not for meeting RPO requirements. Auto scaling doesn't affect RPO."
}
