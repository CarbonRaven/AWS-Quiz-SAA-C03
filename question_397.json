  "question": "A company wants to reduce the cost of its existing three-tier web architecture. The web, application, and database servers are running on Amazon EC2 instances for the development, test, and production environments. The EC2 instances average 30% CPU utilization during peak hours and 10% CPU utilization during non-peak hours.\n\nThe production EC2 instances run 24 hours a day. The development and test EC2 instances run for at least 8 hours each day. The company plans to implement automation to stop the development and test EC2 instances when they are not in use.\n\nWhich EC2 instance purchasing solution will meet the company's requirements MOST cost-effectively?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Use Spot Instances for the production EC2 instances. Use Reserved Instances for the development and test EC2 instances.",
    "B": "Use Reserved Instances for the production EC2 instances. Use On-Demand Instances for the development and test EC2 instances.",
    "C": "Use Spot blocks for the production EC2 instances. Use Reserved Instances for the development and test EC2 instances.",
    "D": "Use Reserved Instances for the production EC2 instances. Use Spot Instances for the development and test EC2 instances."
  },
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": "Reserved Instances for production (24/7 usage) provide significant savings over On-Demand. On-Demand for dev/test is appropriate since they run variable hours and will be stopped when not in use. Spot Instances aren't suitable for production due to potential interruptions. Spot blocks are deprecated. Reserved Instances for dev/test waste money when instances are stopped."
