  "question": "A company manages an application that stores data on an Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL Multi-AZ DB instance. Increases in traffic are causing performance problems. The company determines that database queries are the primary reason for the slow performance.\n\nWhat should a solutions architect do to improve the application's performance?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Serve read traffic from the Multi-AZ standby replica.",
    "B": "Configure the DB instance to use Transfer Acceleration.",
    "C": "Create a read replica from the source DB instance. Serve read traffic from the read replica.",
    "D": "Use Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose between the application and Amazon RDS to increase the concurrency of database requests."
  },
  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": "Read replicas offload read queries from the primary database, improving performance. The Multi-AZ standby replica cannot serve read traffic as it's only for failover. Transfer Acceleration is for S3, not RDS."
}
