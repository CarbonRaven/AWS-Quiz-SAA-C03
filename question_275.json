  "question": "A company runs an internal browser-based application. The application runs on Amazon EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer. The instances run in an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group across multiple Availability Zones. The Auto Scaling group scales up to 20 instances during work hours, but scales down to 2 instances overnight. Staff are complaining that the application is very slow when the day begins, although it runs well by mid-morning.\n\nHow should the scaling be changed to address the staff complaints and keep costs to a minimum?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Implement a scheduled action that sets the desired capacity to 20 shortly before the office opens.",
    "B": "Implement a step scaling action triggered at a lower CPU threshold, and decrease the cooldown period.",
    "C": "Implement a target tracking action triggered at a lower CPU threshold, and decrease the cooldown period.",
    "D": "Implement a scheduled action that sets the minimum and maximum capacity to 20 shortly before the office opens."
  },
  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": "Target tracking scaling with a lower CPU threshold responds more quickly to load increases. Decreased cooldown period allows faster consecutive scaling actions. This addresses the slow morning performance while allowing scale-down for cost savings. Scheduled scaling to 20 instances may over-provision if demand varies. Setting min and max to 20 prevents scale-down, increasing costs."
