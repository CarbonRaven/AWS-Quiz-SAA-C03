  "question": "A company wants to run applications in containers in the AWS Cloud. These applications are stateless and can tolerate disruptions within the underlying infrastructure. The company needs a solution that minimizes cost and operational overhead.\nWhat should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Use Spot Instances in an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group to run the application containers.",
    "B": "Use Spot Instances in an Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) managed node group.",
    "C": "Use On-Demand Instances in an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group to run the application containers.",
    "D": "Use On-Demand Instances in an Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) managed node group."
  },
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": "EKS managed node groups reduce operational overhead for container orchestration. Spot Instances minimize cost for stateless, fault-tolerant applications. EKS with Spot Instances in managed node groups provides both cost optimization and reduced operational burden."
}
