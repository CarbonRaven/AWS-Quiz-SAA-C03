  "question": "An image-hosting company stores its objects in Amazon S3 buckets. The company wants to avoid accidental exposure of the objects in the S3 buckets to the public. All S3 objects in the entire AWS account need to remain private.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Use Amazon GuardDuty to monitor S3 bucket policies. Create an automatic remediation action rule that uses an AWS Lambda function to remediate any change that makes the objects public.",
    "B": "Use AWS Trusted Advisor to find publicly accessible S3 buckets. Configure email notifications in Trusted Advisor when a change is detected. Manually change the S3 bucket policy if it allows public access.",
    "C": "Use AWS Resource Access Manager to find publicly accessible S3 buckets. Use Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) to invoke an AWS Lambda function when a change is detected. Deploy a Lambda function that programmatically remediates the change.",
    "D": "Use the S3 Block Public Access feature on the account level. Use AWS Organizations to create a service control policy (SCP) that prevents IAM users from changing the setting. Apply the SCP to the account."
  },
  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": "S3 Block Public Access at the account level prevents any bucket from being made public. SCP prevents users from disabling this setting. This is a preventive control rather than reactive remediation. GuardDuty detects threats but doesn't manage S3 policies. Trusted Advisor requires manual intervention. Resource Access Manager is for sharing resources, not finding public buckets."
