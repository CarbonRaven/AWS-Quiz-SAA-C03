  "question": "A company runs its media rendering application on premises. The company wants to reduce storage costs and has moved all data to Amazon S3. The on-premises rendering application needs low-latency access to storage.\n\nThe company needs to design a storage solution for the application. The storage solution must maintain the desired application performance.\n\nWhich storage solution will meet these requirements in the MOST cost-effective way?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Use Mountpoint for Amazon S3 to access the data in Amazon S3 for the on-premises application.",
    "B": "Configure an Amazon S3 File Gateway to provide storage for the on-premises application.",
    "C": "Copy the data from Amazon S3 to Amazon FSx for Windows File Server. Configure an Amazon FSx File Gateway to provide storage for the on-premises application.",
    "D": "Configure an on-premises file server. Use the Amazon S3 API to connect to S3 storage. Configure the application to access the storage from the on-premises file server."
  },
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": "Amazon S3 File Gateway provides low-latency access to S3 data for on-premises applications by caching frequently accessed data locally. It presents data as files via NFS/SMB protocols while storing data in S3, making it cost-effective and maintaining performance."
