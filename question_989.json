  "question": "A company runs database workloads on AWS that are the backend for the company's customer portals. The company runs a Multi-AZ database cluster on Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL.\n\nThe company needs to implement a 30-day backup retention policy.

  "options": {
    "A": "Configure the RDS backup retention policy to 30 days for automated backups by using AWS Backup. Manually delete manual backups that are older than 30 days.",
    "B": "Disable RDS automated backups. Delete automated backups and manual backups that are older than 30 days. Configure the RDS backup retention policy to 30 days for automated backups.",
    "C": "Configure the RDS backup retention policy to 30 days for automated backups. Manually delete manual backups that are older than 30 days.",
    "D": "Disable RDS automated backups. Delete automated backups and manual backups that are older than 30 days automatically by using AWS CloudFormation. Configure the RDS backup retention policy to 30 days for automated backups."
  },
