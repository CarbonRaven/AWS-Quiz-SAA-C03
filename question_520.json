  "question": "A company is designing a new web application that will run on Amazon EC2 Instances. The application will use Amazon DynamoDB for backend data storage. The application traffic will be unpredictable. The company expects that the application read and write throughput to the database will be moderate to high. The company needs to scale in response to application traffic.\n\nWhich DynamoDB table configuration will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Configure DynamoDB with provisioned read and write by using the DynamoDB Standard table class. Set DynamoDB auto scaling to a maximum defined capacity.",
    "B": "Configure DynamoDB in on-demand mode by using the DynamoDB Standard table class.",
    "C": "Configure DynamoDB with provisioned read and write by using the DynamoDB Standard Infrequent Access (DynamoDB Standard-IA) table class. Set DynamoDB auto scaling to a maximum defined capacity.",
    "D": "Configure DynamoDB in on-demand mode by using the DynamoDB Standard Infrequent Access (DynamoDB Standard-IA) table class."
  },
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": "On-demand mode is ideal for unpredictable workloads as it automatically scales and charges per request. Standard table class is appropriate for moderate to high throughput. Standard-IA is for infrequently accessed data, which doesn't match the described use case."
}
