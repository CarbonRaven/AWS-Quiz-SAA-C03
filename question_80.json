  "question": "A company recently signed a contract with an AWS Managed Service Provider (MSP) Partner for help with an application migration initiative. A solutions architect needs to share an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) from an existing AWS account with the MSP Partner's AWS account. The AMI is backed by Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) and uses an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer managed key to encrypt EBS volume snapshots.\nWhat is the MOST secure way for the solutions architect to share the AMI with the MSP Partner's AWS account?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Make the encrypted AMI and snapshots publicly available. Modify the key policy to allow the MSP Partner's AWS account to use the key.",
    "B": "Modify the launchPermission property of the AMI. Share the AMI with the MSP Partner's AWS account only. Modify the key policy to allow the MSP Partner's AWS account to use the key.",
    "C": "Modify the launchPermission property of the AMI. Share the AMI with the MSP Partner's AWS account only. Modify the key policy to trust a new KMS key that is owned by the MSP Partner for encryption.",
    "D": "Export the AMI from the source account to an Amazon S3 bucket in the MSP Partner's AWS account. Encrypt the S3 bucket with a new KMS key that is owned by the MSP Partner. Copy and launch the AMI in the MSP Partner's AWS account."
  },
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": "Modifying launchPermission to share with specific account (not public) and granting KMS key access to that account is the most secure approach. Making AMIs public is never secure for sensitive workloads."
