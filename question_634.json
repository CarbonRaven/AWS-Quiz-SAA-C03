  "question": "A company collects 10 GB of telemetry data daily from various machines. The company stores the data in an Amazon S3 bucket in a source data account.\n\nThe company has hired several consulting agencies to use this data for analysis. Each agency needs read access to the data for its analysts. The company must share the data from the source data account by choosing a solution that maximizes security and operational efficiency.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Configure S3 global tables to replicate data for each agency.",
    "B": "Make the S3 bucket public for a limited time. Inform only the agencies.",
    "C": "Configure cross-account access for the S3 bucket to the accounts that the agencies own.",
    "D": "Set up an IAM user for each analyst in the source data account. Grant each user access to the S3 bucket."
  },
  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": "Cross-account access using S3 bucket policies or IAM roles allows secure sharing of data with external AWS accounts without creating users in the source account or making data public. This is the most secure and operationally efficient approach."
}
