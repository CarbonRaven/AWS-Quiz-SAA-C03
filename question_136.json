  "question": "A company is migrating its on-premises PostgreSQL database to Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL. The on-premises database must remain online and accessible during the migration. The Aurora database must remain synchronized with the on-premises database.\nWhich combination of actions must a solutions architect take to meet these requirements? (Choose two.)",
  "options": {
    "A": "Create an ongoing replication task.",
    "B": "Create a database backup of the on-premises database.",
    "C": "Create an AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) replication server.",
    "D": "Convert the database schema by using the AWS Schema Conversion Tool (AWS SCT).",
    "E": "Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule to monitor the database synchronization."
  },
  "correct_answer": ["A", "C"],
  "explanation": "AWS DMS requires a replication instance (server) to perform migrations. An ongoing replication task keeps the source and target synchronized during migration (CDC - Change Data Capture). SCT is for heterogeneous migrations, but PostgreSQL to Aurora PostgreSQL is homogeneous."
