  "question": "A company that uses AWS Organizations runs 150 applications across 30 different AWS accounts. The company used AWS Cost and Usage Report to create a new report in the management account. The report is delivered to an Amazon S3 bucket that is replicated to a bucket in the data collection account.\n\nThe company's senior leadership wants to view a custom dashboard that provides NAT gateway costs each day starting at the beginning of the current month.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Share an Amazon QuickSight dashboard that includes the requested table visual. Configure QuickSight to use AWS DataSync to query the new report.",
    "B": "Share an Amazon QuickSight dashboard that includes the requested table visual. Configure QuickSight to use Amazon Athena to query the new report.",
    "C": "Share an Amazon CloudWatch dashboard that includes the requested table visual. Configure CloudWatch to use AWS DataSync to query the new report.",
    "D": "Share an Amazon CloudWatch dashboard that includes the requested table visual. Configure CloudWatch to use Amazon Athena to query the new report."
  },
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": "QuickSight with Athena can query Cost and Usage Reports stored in S3 and create custom dashboards. DataSync is for data transfer, not querying. CloudWatch dashboards don't support this type of cost analysis."
}
