  "question": "A company is implementing a shared storage solution for a gaming application that is hosted in the AWS Cloud. The company needs the ability to use Lustre clients to access data. The solution must be fully managed.\n\nWhich solution meets these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Create an AWS DataSync task that shares the data as a mountable file system. Mount the file system to the application server.",
    "B": "Create an AWS Storage Gateway file gateway. Create a file share that uses the required client protocol. Connect the application server to the file share.",
    "C": "Create an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file system, and configure it to support Lustre. Attach the file system to the origin server. Connect the application server to the file system.",
    "D": "Create an Amazon FSx for Lustre file system. Attach the file system to the origin server. Connect the application server to the file system."
  },
  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": "Amazon FSx for Lustre is a fully managed file system that provides native Lustre client support. It's designed for high-performance computing and machine learning workloads. DataSync is for data transfer, not file sharing. Storage Gateway doesn't support Lustre. EFS uses NFS protocol, not Lustre."
