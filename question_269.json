  "question": "An ecommerce company has noticed performance degradation of its Amazon RDS based web application. The performance degradation is attributed to an increase in the number of read-only SQL queries triggered by business analysts. A solutions architect needs to solve the problem with minimal changes to the existing web application.\n\nWhat should the solutions architect recommend?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Export the data to Amazon DynamoDB and have the business analysts run their queries.",
    "B": "Load the data into Amazon ElastiCache and have the business analysts run their queries.",
    "C": "Create a read replica of the primary database and have the business analysts run their queries.",
    "D": "Copy the data into an Amazon Redshift cluster and have the business analysts run their queries."
  },
  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": "RDS read replicas offload read traffic from the primary database without requiring application changes to the main web application. Business analysts can connect to the read replica for their queries. DynamoDB would require query rewrites. ElastiCache is for caching, not SQL queries. Redshift is good for analytics but requires data migration and query changes."
