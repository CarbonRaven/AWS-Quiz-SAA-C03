  "question": "A security audit reveals that Amazon EC2 instances are not being patched regularly. A solutions architect needs to provide a solution that will run regular security scans across a large fleet of EC2 instances. The solution should also patch the EC2 instances on a regular schedule and provide a report of each instance's patch status.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Set up Amazon Macie to scan the EC2 instances for software vulnerabilities. Set up a cron job on each EC2 instance to patch the instance on a regular schedule.",
    "B": "Turn on Amazon GuardDuty in the account. Configure GuardDuty to scan the EC2 instances for software vulnerabilities. Set up AWS Systems Manager Session Manager to patch the EC2 instances on a regular schedule.",
    "C": "Set up Amazon Detective to scan the EC2 instances for software vulnerabilities. Set up an Amazon EventBridge scheduled rule to patch the EC2 instances on a regular schedule.",
    "D": "Turn on Amazon Inspector in the account. Configure Amazon Inspector to scan the EC2 instances for software vulnerabilities. Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to patch the EC2 instances on a regular schedule."
  },
  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": "Amazon Inspector scans for vulnerabilities and provides reports. Systems Manager Patch Manager automates patching on schedules with compliance reporting. Macie is for sensitive data discovery. GuardDuty is for threat detection, not vulnerability scanning. Detective is for security investigation, not scanning. Cron jobs add operational overhead."
