  "question": "A company runs a real-time data ingestion solution on AWS. The solution consists of the most recent version of Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (Amazon MSK). The solution is deployed in a VPC in private subnets across three Availability Zones.\n\nA solutions architect needs to redesign the data ingestion solution to be publicly available over the internet. The data in transit must also be encrypted.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements with the MOST operational efficiency?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Configure public subnets in the existing VPC. Deploy an MSK cluster in the public subnets. Update the MSK cluster security settings to enable mutual TLS authentication.",
    "B": "Create a new VPC that has public subnets. Deploy an MSK cluster in the public subnets. Update the MSK cluster security settings to enable mutual TLS authentication.",
    "C": "Deploy an Application Load Balancer (ALB) that uses private subnets. Configure an ALB security group inbound rule to allow inbound traffic from the VPC CIDR block for HTTPS protocol.",
    "D": "Deploy a Network Load Balancer (NLB) that uses private subnets. Configure an NLB listener for HTTPS communication over the internet."
  },
  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": "MSK supports public access when deployed in public subnets. Configuring public subnets in the existing VPC and enabling mutual TLS authentication provides encrypted data in transit and public accessibility with the least operational overhead."
