  "question": "A company wants to migrate its three-tier application from on premises to AWS. The web tier and the application tier are running on third-party virtual machines (VMs). The database tier is running on MySQL.\n\nThe company needs to migrate the application by making the fewest possible changes to the architecture. The company also needs a database solution that can restore data to a specific point in time.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Migrate the web tier and the application tier to Amazon EC2 instances in private subnets. Migrate the database tier to Amazon RDS for MySQL in private subnets.",
    "B": "Migrate the web tier to Amazon EC2 instances in public subnets. Migrate the application tier to EC2 instances in private subnets. Migrate the database tier to Amazon Aurora MySQL in private subnets.",
    "C": "Migrate the web tier to Amazon EC2 instances in public subnets. Migrate the application tier to EC2 instances in private subnets. Migrate the database tier to Amazon RDS for MySQL in private subnets.",
    "D": "Migrate the web tier and the application tier to Amazon EC2 instances in public subnets. Migrate the database tier to Amazon Aurora MySQL in public subnets."
  },
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": "Aurora MySQL provides automated point-in-time recovery with minimal operational overhead. The proper architecture places web tier in public subnets, and application/database tiers in private subnets for security. Aurora offers better performance and managed features compared to RDS MySQL while maintaining MySQL compatibility."
