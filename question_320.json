  "question": "A company is using a fleet of Amazon EC2 instances to ingest data from on-premises data sources. The data is in JSON format and ingestion rates can be as high as 1 MB/s. When an EC2 instance is rebooted, the data in-flight is lost. The company's data science team wants to query ingested data in near-real time.\n\nWhich solution provides near-real-time data querying that is scalable with minimal data loss?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Publish data to Amazon Kinesis Data Streams. Use Kinesis Data Analytics to query the data.",
    "B": "Publish data to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose with Amazon Redshift as the destination. Use Amazon Redshift to query the data.",
    "C": "Store ingested data in an EC2 instance store. Publish data to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose with Amazon S3 as the destination. Use Amazon Athena to query the data.",
    "D": "Store ingested data in an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume. Publish data to Amazon ElastiCache for Redis. Subscribe to the Redis channel to query the data."
  },
  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": "Kinesis Data Streams provides durable storage preventing data loss during EC2 reboots. Kinesis Data Analytics enables near-real-time SQL queries on streaming data. Firehose with Redshift has higher latency. Instance store data is lost on reboot. ElastiCache isn't designed for querying analytical data."
