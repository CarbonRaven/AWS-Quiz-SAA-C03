  "question": "A company is preparing to launch a public-facing web application in the AWS Cloud. The architecture consists of Amazon EC2 instances within a VPC behind an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB). A third-party service is used for the DNS. The company's solutions architect must recommend a solution to detect and protect against large-scale DDoS attacks.\nWhich solution meets these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Enable Amazon GuardDuty on the account.",
    "B": "Enable Amazon Inspector on the EC2 instances.",
    "C": "Enable AWS Shield and assign Amazon Route 53 to it.",
    "D": "Enable AWS Shield Advanced and assign the ELB to it."
  },
  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": "AWS Shield Advanced provides enhanced DDoS protection for ELB, CloudFront, and Route 53. Since the company uses a third-party DNS, Shield Advanced should be assigned to the ELB for protection."
}
