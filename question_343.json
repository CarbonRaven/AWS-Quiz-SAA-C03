  "question": "A solutions architect is designing a company's disaster recovery (DR) architecture. The company has a MySQL database that runs on an Amazon EC2 instance in a private subnet with scheduled backup. The DR design needs to include multiple AWS Regions.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Migrate the MySQL database to multiple EC2 instances. Configure a standby EC2 instance in the DR Region. Turn on replication.",
    "B": "Migrate the MySQL database to Amazon RDS. Use a Multi-AZ deployment. Turn on read replication for the primary DB instance in the different Availability Zones.",
    "C": "Migrate the MySQL database to an Amazon Aurora global database. Host the primary DB cluster in the primary Region. Host the secondary DB cluster in the DR Region.",
    "D": "Store the scheduled backup of the MySQL database in an Amazon S3 bucket that is configured for S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR). Use the data backup to restore the database in the DR Region."
  },
  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": "Aurora global database provides automatic cross-region replication with minimal operational overhead. It's fully managed with sub-second replication. EC2 MySQL replication requires manual configuration. RDS Multi-AZ is single-region. S3 CRR with backup restoration has higher RTO and requires manual restore process."
