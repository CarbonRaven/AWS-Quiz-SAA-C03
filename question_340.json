  "question": "A media company hosts its website on AWS. The website application's architecture includes a fleet of Amazon EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB) and a database that is hosted on Amazon Aurora. The company's cybersecurity team reports that the application is vulnerable to SQL injection.\n\nHow should the company resolve this issue?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Use AWS WAF in front of the ALB. Associate the appropriate web ACLs with AWS WAF.",
    "B": "Create an ALB listener rule to reply to SQL injections with a fixed response.",
    "C": "Subscribe to AWS Shield Advanced to block all SQL injection attempts automatically.",
    "D": "Set up Amazon Inspector to block all SQL injection attempts automatically."
  },
  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": "AWS WAF provides web application firewall rules including SQL injection protection. WAF web ACLs can be associated with ALB to inspect and block malicious requests. ALB listener rules can't detect SQL injection. Shield Advanced is for DDoS protection. Inspector scans for vulnerabilities but doesn't block traffic."
