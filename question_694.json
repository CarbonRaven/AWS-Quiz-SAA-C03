  "question": "A company is building a shopping application on AWS. The application offers a catalog that changes once each month and needs to scale with traffic volume. The company wants the lowest possible latency from the application. Data from each user's shopping cart needs to be highly available. User session data must be available even if the user is disconnected and reconnects.\n\nWhat should a solutions architect do to ensure that the shopping cart data is preserved at all times?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Configure an Application Load Balancer to enable the sticky sessions feature (session affinity) for access to the catalog in Amazon Aurora.",
    "B": "Configure Amazon ElastiCache for Redis to cache catalog data from Amazon DynamoDB and shopping cart data from the user's session.",
    "C": "Configure Amazon OpenSearch Service to cache catalog data from Amazon DynamoDB and shopping cart data from the user's session.",
    "D": "Configure an Amazon EC2 instance with Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) storage for the catalog and shopping cart. Configure automated snapshots."
  },
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": "ElastiCache for Redis provides in-memory caching for low latency, supports session persistence (data survives disconnection), and high availability with replication. It can cache both catalog data and shopping cart sessions. DynamoDB provides durable storage for cart data."
}
