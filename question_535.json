  "question": "A company is building an Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) cluster for its workloads. All secrets that are stored in Amazon EKS must be encrypted in the Kubernetes etcd key-value store.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Create a new AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key. Use AWS Secrets Manager to manage, rotate, and store all secrets in Amazon EKS.",
    "B": "Create a new AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key. Enable Amazon EKS KMS secrets encryption on the Amazon EKS cluster.",
    "C": "Create the Amazon EKS cluster with default options. Use the Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver as an add-on.",
    "D": "Create a new AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key with the alias/aws/ebs alias. Enable default Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume encryption for the account."
  },
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": "EKS supports envelope encryption of Kubernetes secrets using a KMS key. When enabled, EKS encrypts secrets stored in etcd with the specified KMS key. This is a native EKS feature specifically designed for encrypting secrets in the etcd store."
