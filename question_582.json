  "question": "An ecommerce company uses Amazon Route 53 as its DNS provider. The company hosts its website on premises and in the AWS Cloud. The company's on-premises data center is near the us-west-1 Region. The company uses the eu-central-1 Region to host the website. The company wants to minimize load time for the website as much as possible.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Set up a geolocation routing policy. Send the traffic that is near us-west-1 to the on-premises data center. Send the traffic that is near eu-central-1 to eu-central-1.",
    "B": "Set up a simple routing policy that routes all traffic that is near eu-central-1 to eu-central-1 and routes all traffic that is near the on-premises datacenter to the on-premises data center.",
    "C": "Set up a latency routing policy. Associate the policy with us-west-1.",
    "D": "Set up a weighted routing policy. Split the traffic evenly between eu-central-1 and the on-premises data center."
  },
  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": "Geolocation routing directs traffic based on user location, sending users to the nearest endpoint. Users near US West Coast go to on-premises (near us-west-1), and European users go to eu-central-1, minimizing load times based on geographic proximity."
