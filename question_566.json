  "question": "A company runs multiple Amazon EC2 Linux instances in a VPC across two Availability Zones. The instances host applications that use a hierarchical directory structure. The applications need to read and write rapidly and concurrently to shared storage.\n\nWhat should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Create an Amazon S3 bucket. Allow access from all the EC2 instances in the VPC.",
    "B": "Create an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file system. Mount the EFS file system from each EC2 instance.",
    "C": "Create a file system on a Provisioned IOPS SSD (io2) Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume. Attach the EBS volume to all the EC2 instances.",
    "D": "Create file systems on Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes that are attached to each EC2 instance. Synchronize the EBS volumes across the different EC2 instances."
  },
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": "Amazon EFS provides a shared file system that can be mounted by multiple EC2 instances across Availability Zones. It supports concurrent read/write access and hierarchical directory structures. EBS volumes can only be attached to one instance at a time."
