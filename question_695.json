  "question": "A company is building a microservices-based application that will be deployed on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS). The microservices will interact with each other. The company wants to ensure that the application is observable to identify performance issues in the future.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Configure the application to use Amazon ElastiCache to reduce the number of requests that are sent to the microservices.",
    "B": "Configure Amazon CloudWatch Container Insights to collect metrics from the EKS clusters. Configure AWS X-Ray to trace the requests between the microservices.",
    "C": "Configure AWS CloudTrail to review the API calls. Build an Amazon QuickSight dashboard to observe the microservice interactions.",
    "D": "Use AWS Trusted Advisor to understand the performance of the application."
  },
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": "CloudWatch Container Insights provides metrics for containerized applications on EKS. AWS X-Ray provides distributed tracing to track requests across microservices and identify performance bottlenecks. Together they provide comprehensive observability for microservices."
