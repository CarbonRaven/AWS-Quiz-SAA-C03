  "question": "A company that uses AWS needs a solution to predict the resources needed for manufacturing processes each month. The solution must use historical values that are currently stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. The company has no machine learning (ML) experience and wants to use a managed service for the training and predictions.\n\nWhich combination of steps will meet these requirements? (Choose two.)",
  "options": {
    "A": "Deploy an Amazon SageMaker model. Create a SageMaker endpoint for inference.",
    "B": "Use Amazon SageMaker to train a model by using the historical data in the S3 bucket.",
    "C": "Configure an AWS Lambda function with a function URL that uses Amazon SageMaker endpoints to create predictions based on the inputs.",
    "D": "Configure an AWS Lambda function with a function URL that uses an Amazon Forecast predictor to create a prediction based on the inputs.",
    "E": "Train an Amazon Forsecast predictor by using the historical data in the S3 bucket."
  },
  "correct_answer": ["D", "E"],
  "explanation": "Amazon Forecast is a fully managed service designed for time-series forecasting without ML experience. It can train on historical data from S3 and make predictions. SageMaker requires more ML expertise. Lambda with Forecast predictor provides the prediction interface."
