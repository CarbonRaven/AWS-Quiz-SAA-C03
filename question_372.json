  "question": "A company is storing backup files by using Amazon S3 Standard storage. The files are accessed frequently for 1 month. However, the files are not accessed after 1 month. The company must keep the files indefinitely.\n\nWhich storage solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Configure S3 Intelligent-Tiering to automatically migrate objects.",
    "B": "Create an S3 Lifecycle configuration to transition objects from S3 Standard to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 1 month.",
    "C": "Create an S3 Lifecycle configuration to transition objects from S3 Standard to S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) after 1 month.",
    "D": "Create an S3 Lifecycle configuration to transition objects from S3 Standard to S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA) after 1 month."
  },
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": "S3 Glacier Deep Archive is the most cost-effective storage for data that is accessed very rarely and stored indefinitely. After 1 month with no access, transitioning to Deep Archive provides the lowest storage cost. S3 Standard-IA and One Zone-IA are more expensive for long-term archival. Intelligent-Tiering has monitoring fees and won't reach Deep Archive tier."
