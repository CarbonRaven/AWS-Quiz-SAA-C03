  "question": "A company creates dedicated AWS accounts in AWS Organizations for its business units. Recently, an important notification was sent to the root user email address of a business unit account instead of the assigned account owner. The company wants to ensure that all future notifications can be sent to different employees based on the notification categories of billing, operations, or security.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements MOST securely?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Configure each AWS account to use a single email address that the company manages. Ensure that all account owners can access the email account to receive notifications. Configure alternate contacts for each AWS account with corresponding distribution lists for the billing team, the security team, and the operations team for each business unit.",
    "B": "Configure each AWS account to use a different email distribution list for each business unit that the company manages. Configure each distribution list with administrator email addresses that can respond to alerts. Configure alternate contacts for each AWS account with corresponding distribution lists for the billing team, the security team, and the operations team for each business unit.",
    "C": "Configure each AWS account root user email address to be the individual company managed email address of one person from each business unit. Configure alternate contacts for each AWS account with corresponding distribution lists for the billing team, the security team, and the operations team for each business unit.",
    "D": "Configure each AWS account root user to use email aliases that go to a centralized mailbox. Configure alternate contacts for each account by using a single business managed email distribution list each for the billing team, the security team, and the operations team."
  },
  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": "Centralized email aliases for root users with separate alternate contacts for billing, security, and operations teams provides secure, organized notification routing. This allows proper segregation of notification types while maintaining central control."
