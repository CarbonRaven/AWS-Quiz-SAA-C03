  "question": "A company is designing its production application's disaster recovery (DR) strategy. The application is backed by a MySQL database on an Amazon Aurora cluster in the us-east-1 Region. The company has chosen the us-west-1 Region as its DR Region.\n\nThe company's target recovery point objective (RPO) is 5 minutes and the target recovery time objective (RTO) is 20 minutes. The company wants to minimize configuration changes.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements with the MOST operational efficiency?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Create an Aurora read replica in us-west-1 similar in size to the production application's Aurora MySQL cluster writer instance.",
    "B": "Convert the Aurora cluster to an Aurora global database. Configure managed failover.",
    "C": "Create a new Aurora cluster in us-west-1 that has Cross-Region Replication.",
    "D": "Create a new Aurora cluster in us-west-1. Use AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) to sync both clusters."
  },
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": "Aurora Global Database provides sub-second replication (RPO < 1 second) and managed failover (RTO < 1 minute), exceeding the 5-minute RPO and 20-minute RTO requirements with minimal configuration changes and maximum operational efficiency."
