  "question": "A company is developing a new mobile app. The company must implement proper traffic filtering to protect its Application Load Balancer (ALB) against common application-level attacks, such as cross-site scripting or SQL injection. The company has minimal infrastructure and operational staff. The company needs to reduce its share of the responsibility in managing, updating, and securing servers for its AWS environment.\nWhat should a solutions architect recommend to meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Configure AWS WAF rules and associate them with the ALB.",
    "B": "Deploy the application using Amazon S3 with public hosting enabled.",
    "C": "Deploy AWS Shield Advanced and add the ALB as a protected resource.",
    "D": "Create a new ALB that directs traffic to an Amazon EC2 instance running a third-party firewall, which then passes the traffic to the current ALB."
  },
  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": "AWS WAF protects against application-level attacks like SQL injection and XSS with managed rule sets. It's a fully managed service that integrates directly with ALB, reducing operational overhead. Shield Advanced is for DDoS protection, not application-layer attacks."
