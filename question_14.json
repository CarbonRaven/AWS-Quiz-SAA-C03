  "question": "A company runs an ecommerce application on Amazon EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer. The instances run in an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group across multiple Availability Zones. The Auto Scaling group scales based on CPU utilization metrics. The ecommerce application stores the transaction data in a MySQL 8.0 database that is hosted on a large EC2 instance.\nThe database's performance degrades quickly as application load increases. The application handles more read requests than write transactions. The company wants a solution that will automatically scale the database to meet the demand of unpredictable read workloads while maintaining high availability.\nWhich solution will meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Use Amazon Redshift with a single node for leader and compute functionality.",
    "B": "Use Amazon RDS with a Single-AZ deployment Configure Amazon RDS to add reader instances in a different Availability Zone.",
    "C": "Use Amazon Aurora with a Multi-AZ deployment. Configure Aurora Auto Scaling with Aurora Replicas.",
    "D": "Use Amazon ElastiCache for Memcached with EC2 Spot Instances."
  },
  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": "Aurora with Multi-AZ provides high availability, and Aurora Auto Scaling automatically adjusts the number of Aurora Replicas to handle unpredictable read workloads. Aurora Replicas can scale from 0 to 15 based on demand."
}
