  "question": "A company runs an environment where data is stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. The objects are accessed frequently throughout the day. The company has strict data encryption requirements for data that is stored in the S3 bucket. The company currently uses AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) for encryption.\n\nThe company wants to optimize costs associated with encrypting S3 objects without making additional calls to AWS KMS.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Use server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3).",
    "B": "Use an S3 Bucket Key for server-side encryption with AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS) on the new objects.",
    "C": "Use client-side encryption with AWS KMS customer managed keys.",
    "D": "Use server-side encryption with customer-provided keys (SSE-C) stored in AWS KMS."
  },
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": "S3 Bucket Keys reduce the cost of SSE-KMS by decreasing request traffic from S3 to KMS. Instead of individual KMS API calls for each object, S3 uses a bucket-level key to create data keys, reducing KMS request costs by up to 99%. This maintains KMS encryption while optimizing costs."
