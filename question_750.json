The company wants to use the existing IdP for authentication to AWS.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Create IAM users for the employees in the required AWS accounts. Connect IAM users to the existing IdP. Configure federated authentication for the IAM users.",
    "B": "Set up AWS account root users with user email addresses and passwords that are synchronized from the existing IdP.",
    "C": "Configure AWS IAM Identity Center (AWS Single Sign-On). Connect IAM Identity Center to the existing IdP. Provision users and groups from the existing IdP.",
    "D": "Use AWS Resource Access Manager (AWS RAM) to share access to the AWS accounts with the users in the existing IdP."
  },
  "correct_answer": "C",
