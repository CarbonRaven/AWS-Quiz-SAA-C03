  "question": "A company is designing an application where users upload small files into Amazon S3. After the file is uploaded, the file requires one-time simple processing to transform the data and save the data in JSON format for later analysis.\n\nEach file must be processed as quickly as possible after it is uploaded. Demand will vary. On some days, users will upload a high number of files; on other days, users will upload a few files or no files.\n\nWhich solution meets these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Configure Amazon EMR to read text files from Amazon S3. Run processing scripts to transform the data. Store the resulting JSON file in an Amazon Aurora DB cluster.",
    "B": "Configure Amazon S3 to send an event notification to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Use Amazon EC2 instances to read from the queue and process the data. Store the resulting JSON file in Amazon DynamoDB.",
    "C": "Configure Amazon S3 to send an event notification to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Use an AWS Lambda function to read from the queue and process the data. Store the resulting JSON file in Amazon DynamoDB.",
    "D": "Configure Amazon EventBridge to send an event to Amazon Kinesis Data Streams when a new file is uploaded. Use an AWS Lambda function to consume the event from the stream and process the data. Store the resulting JSON file in Amazon Aurora DB cluster."
  },
  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": "S3 event notifications to SQS with Lambda provides serverless, scalable processing with minimal operational overhead. Lambda scales automatically with demand. EMR and EC2 require more management. Kinesis Data Streams is more complex than needed for simple file processing. DynamoDB is ideal for JSON storage."
