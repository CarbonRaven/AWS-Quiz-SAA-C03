  "question": "A company wants to implement a backup strategy for Amazon EC2 data and multiple Amazon S3 buckets. Because of regulatory requirements, the company must retain backup files for a specific time period. The company must not alter the files for the duration of the retention period.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Use AWS Backup to create a backup vault that has a vault lock in governance mode. Create the required backup plan.",
    "B": "Use Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager to create the required automated snapshot policy.",
    "C": "Use Amazon S3 File Gateway to create the backup. Configure the appropriate S3 Lifecycle management.",
    "D": "Use AWS Backup to create a backup vault that has a vault lock in compliance mode. Create the required backup plan."
  },
  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": "AWS Backup vault lock in compliance mode provides WORM (Write Once Read Many) protection that prevents anyone, including root users, from deleting or altering backups during the retention period. Governance mode allows users with special permissions to modify settings, which doesn't meet the immutability requirement."
