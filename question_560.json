  "question": "A company's solutions architect is designing an AWS multi-account solution that uses AWS Organizations. The solutions architect has organized the company's accounts into organizational units (OUs).\n\nThe solutions architect needs a solution that will identify any changes to the OU hierarchy. The solution also needs to notify the company's operations team of any changes.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Provision the AWS accounts by using AWS Control Tower. Use account drift notifications to identify the changes to the OU hierarchy.",
    "B": "Provision the AWS accounts by using AWS Control Tower. Use AWS Config aggregated rules to identify the changes to the OU hierarchy.",
    "C": "Use AWS Service Catalog to create accounts in Organizations. Use an AWS CloudTrail organization trail to identify the changes to the OU hierarchy.",
    "D": "Use AWS CloudFormation templates to create accounts in Organizations. Use the drift detection operation on a stack to identify the changes to the OU hierarchy."
  },
  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": "AWS Control Tower provides built-in account drift notifications that automatically detect and alert on changes to the OU hierarchy. This is a managed feature requiring least operational overhead compared to setting up custom monitoring solutions."
