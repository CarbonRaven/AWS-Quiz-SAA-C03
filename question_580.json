  "question": "A company uses locally attached storage to run a latency-sensitive application on premises. The company is using a lift and shift method to move the application to the AWS Cloud. The company does not want to change the application architecture.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Configure an Auto Scaling group with an Amazon EC2 instance. Use an Amazon FSx for Lustre file system to run the application.",
    "B": "Host the application on an Amazon EC2 instance. Use an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) GP2 volume to run the application.",
    "C": "Configure an Auto Scaling group with an Amazon EC2 instance. Use an Amazon FSx for OpenZFS file system to run the application.",
    "D": "Host the application on an Amazon EC2 instance. Use an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) GP3 volume to run the application."
  },
  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": "For lift and shift of a latency-sensitive application using local storage, EBS provides block storage attached to EC2. GP3 volumes are more cost-effective than GP2 with better baseline performance. FSx adds unnecessary complexity and cost for this use case."
