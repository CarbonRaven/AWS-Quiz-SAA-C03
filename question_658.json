  "question": "A company uses an on-premises network-attached storage (NAS) system to provide file shares to its high performance computing (HPC) workloads. The company wants to migrate its latency-sensitive HPC workloads and its storage to the AWS Cloud. The company must be able to provide NFS and SMB multi-protocol access from the file system.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST latency? (Choose two.)",
  "options": {
    "A": "Deploy compute optimized EC2 instances into a cluster placement group.",
    "B": "Deploy compute optimized EC2 instances into a partition placement group.",
    "C": "Attach the EC2 instances to an Amazon FSx for Lustre file system.",
    "D": "Attach the EC2 instances to an Amazon FSx for OpenZFS file system.",
    "E": "Attach the EC2 instances to an Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP file system."
  },
  "correct_answer": ["A", "E"],
  "explanation": "Cluster placement groups provide the lowest network latency for HPC workloads by placing instances close together. FSx for NetApp ONTAP is the only FSx option that supports both NFS and SMB multi-protocol access. Lustre only supports NFS, and OpenZFS only supports NFS."
