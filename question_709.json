  "question": "A company has an organization in AWS Organizations. The company runs Amazon EC2 instances across four AWS accounts in the root organizational unit (OU). There are three nonproduction accounts and one production account. The company wants to prohibit users from launching EC2 instances of a certain size in the nonproduction accounts. The company has created a service control policy (SCP) to deny access to launch instances that use the prohibited types.\n\nWhich solutions to deploy the SCP will meet these requirements? (Choose two.)",
  "options": {
    "A": "Attach the SCP to the root OU for the organization.",
    "B": "Attach the SCP to the three nonproduction Organizations member accounts.",
    "C": "Attach the SCP to the Organizations management account.",
    "D": "Create an OU for the production account. Attach the SCP to the OU. Move the production member account into the new OU.",
    "E": "Create an OU for the required accounts. Attach the SCP to the OU. Move the nonproduction member accounts into the new OU."
  },
  "correct_answer": ["B", "E"],
  "explanation": "To restrict only nonproduction accounts: either attach the SCP directly to the three nonproduction accounts (B), or create a new OU for nonproduction accounts, move them there, and attach the SCP to that OU (E). Attaching to root OU would affect all accounts including production."
