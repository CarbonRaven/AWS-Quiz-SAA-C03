  "question": "A company needs to use its on-premises LDAP directory service to authenticate its users to the AWS Management Console. The directory service is not compatible with Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML).\n\nWhich solution meets these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Enable AWS IAM Identity Center (AWS Single Sign-On) between AWS and the on-premises LDAP.",
    "B": "Create an IAM policy that uses AWS credentials, and integrate the policy into LDAP.",
    "C": "Set up a process that rotates the IAM credentials whenever LDAP credentials are updated.",
    "D": "Develop an on-premises custom identity broker application or process that uses AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS) to get short-lived credentials."
  },
  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": "When the identity provider is not SAML-compatible, a custom identity broker must be developed. The broker authenticates users against LDAP and then uses AWS STS to obtain temporary security credentials for AWS access. This is the standard approach for non-SAML identity providers."
}
