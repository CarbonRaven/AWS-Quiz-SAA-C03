  "question": "A company has applications that run in an organization in AWS Organizations. The company outsources operational support of the applications. The company needs to provide access for the external support engineers without compromising security.\n\nThe external support engineers need access to the AWS Management Console. The external support engineers also need operating system access to the company's fleet of Amazon EC2 instances that run Amazon Linux in private subnets.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements MOST securely?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Confirm that AWS Systems Manager Agent (SSM Agent) is installed on all instances. Assign an instance profile with the necessary policy to connect to Systems Manager. Use AWS IAM Identity Center to provide the external support engineers console access. Use Systems Manager Session Manager to assign the required permissions.",
    "B": "Confirm that AWS Systems Manager Agent (SSM Agent) is installed on all instances. Assign an instance profile with the necessary policy to connect to Systems Manager. Use Systems Manager Session Manager to provide local IAM user credentials in each AWS account to the external support engineers for console access.",
    "C": "Confirm that all instances have a security group that allows SSH access only from the external support engineers' source IP address ranges. Provide local IAM user credentials in each AWS account to the external support engineers for console access. Provide each external support engineer an SSH key pair to log in to the application instances.",
    "D": "Create a bastion host in a public subnet. Set up the bastion host security group to allow access from only the external engineers' IP address ranges. Ensure that all instances have a security group that allows SSH access from the bastion host. Provide each external support engineer an SSH key pair to log in to the application instances. Provide local account IAM user credentials to the engineers for console access."
  },
  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": "IAM Identity Center provides centralized, secure console access across multiple accounts. Session Manager provides secure shell access without SSH keys or bastion hosts, with full audit logging."
