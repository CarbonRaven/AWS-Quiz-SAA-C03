  "question_text": "A financial services company wants to shut down two data centers and migrate more than 100 TB of data to AWS. The data has an intricate directory structure with millions of small files stored in deep hierarchies of subfolders. Most of the data is unstructured, and the company’s file storage consists of SMB-based storage types from multiple vendors. The company does not want to change its applications to access the data after migration. What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?",
