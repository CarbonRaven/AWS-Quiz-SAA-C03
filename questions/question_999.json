  "question_text": "A company is creating a prototype of an ecommerce website on AWS. The website consists of an Application Load Balancer, an Auto Scaling group of Amazon EC2 instances for web servers, and an Amazon RDS for MySQL DB instance that runs with the Single-AZ configuration. The website is slow to respond during searches of the product catalog. The product catalog is a group of tables in the MySQL database that the company does not update frequently. A solutions architect has determined that the CPU utilization on the DB instance is high when product catalog searches occur. What should the solutions architect recommend to improve the performance of the website during searches of the product catalog?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Migrate the product catalog to an Amazon Redshift database. Use the COPY command to load the product catalog tables.",
    "B": "Implement an Amazon ElastiCache for Redis cluster to cache the product catalog. Use lazy loading to populate the cache.",
    "C": "Add an additional scaling policy to the Auto Scaling group to launch additional EC2 instances when database response is slow.",
    "D": "Turn on the Multi-AZ configuration for the DB instance. Configure the EC2 instances to throttle the product catalog queries that are sent to the database."
