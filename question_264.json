  "question": "A company has a web application hosted over 10 Amazon EC2 instances with traffic directed by Amazon Route 53. The company occasionally experiences a timeout error when attempting to browse the application. The networking team finds that some DNS queries return IP addresses of unhealthy instances, resulting in the timeout error.\n\nWhat should a solutions architect implement to overcome these timeout errors?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Create a Route 53 simple routing policy record for each EC2 instance. Associate a health check with each record.",
    "B": "Create a Route 53 failover routing policy record for each EC2 instance. Associate a health check with each record.",
    "C": "Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution with EC2 instances as its origin. Associate a health check with the EC2 instances.",
    "D": "Create an Application Load Balancer (ALB) with a health check in front of the EC2 instances. Route to the ALB from Route 53."
  },
  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": "An ALB performs continuous health checks and automatically stops routing traffic to unhealthy instances. Route 53 points to the ALB's single DNS name. Simple routing with health checks on each instance would be complex to manage for 10 instances. Failover routing is for active-passive setups, not load balancing 10 instances. CloudFront is for content caching, not health-based routing."
