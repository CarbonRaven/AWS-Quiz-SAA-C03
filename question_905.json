  "question": "A company wants to improve the availability and performance of its hybrid application. The application consists of a stateful TCP-based workload hosted on Amazon EC2 instances in different AWS Regions and a stateless UDP-based workload hosted on premises.\n\nWhich combination of actions should a solutions architect take to improve availability and performance? (Choose two.)",
  "options": {
    "A": "Create an accelerator using AWS Global Accelerator. Add the load balancers as endpoints.",
    "B": "Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution with an origin that uses Amazon Route 53 latency-based routing to route requests to the load balancers.",
    "C": "Configure two Application Load Balancers in each Region. The first will route to the EC2 endpoints, and the second will route to the on-premises endpoints.",
    "D": "Configure a Network Load Balancer in each Region to address the EC2 endpoints. Configure a Network Load Balancer in each Region that routes to the on-premises endpoints.",
    "E": "Configure a Network Load Balancer in each Region to address the EC2 endpoints. Configure an Application Load Balancer in each Region that routes to the on-premises endpoints."
  },
  "correct_answer": ["A", "D"],
  "explanation": "Global Accelerator improves availability and performance for hybrid applications. NLB is required for TCP and UDP workloads (ALB only supports HTTP/HTTPS). NLBs handle both the EC2 endpoints and on-premises endpoints."
