  "question": "A company is designing a tightly coupled high performance computing (HPC) environment in the AWS Cloud. The company needs to include features that will optimize the HPC environment for networking and storage.\n\nWhich combination of solutions will meet these requirements? (Choose two.)",
  "options": {
    "A": "Create an accelerator in AWS Global Accelerator. Configure custom routing for the accelerator.",
    "B": "Create an Amazon FSx for Lustre file system. Configure the file system with scratch storage.",
    "C": "Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution. Configure the viewer protocol policy to be HTTP and HTTPS.",
    "D": "Launch Amazon EC2 instances. Attach an Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) to the instances.",
    "E": "Create an AWS Elastic Beanstalk deployment to manage the environment."
  },
  "correct_answer": ["B", "D"],
  "explanation": "Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) provides low-latency, high-bandwidth networking for tightly coupled HPC workloads. FSx for Lustre with scratch storage provides high-performance parallel file system optimized for HPC workloads with high throughput. Global Accelerator and CloudFront are for global content delivery, not HPC."
