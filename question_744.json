  "question": "A company is designing a new web service that will run on Amazon EC2 instances behind an Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) load balancer. However, many of the web service clients can only reach IP addresses authorized on their firewalls.\n\nWhat should a solutions architect recommend to meet the clients' needs?",
  "options": {
    "A": "A Network Load Balancer with an associated Elastic IP address.",
    "B": "An Application Load Balancer with an associated Elastic IP address.",
    "C": "An A record in an Amazon Route 53 hosted zone pointing to an Elastic IP address.",
    "D": "An EC2 instance with a public IP address running as a proxy in front of the load balancer."
  },
  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": "Network Load Balancer supports static IP addresses through Elastic IPs, which clients can whitelist on their firewalls. Application Load Balancer does not support Elastic IP addresses directly. NLB provides stable IP addresses for clients with firewall restrictions."
}
