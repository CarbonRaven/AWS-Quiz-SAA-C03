  "question": "A financial services company plans to launch a new application on AWS to handle sensitive financial transactions. The company will deploy the application on Amazon EC2 instances. The company will use Amazon RDS for MySQL as the database. The company's security policies mandate that data must be encrypted at rest and in transit.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Configure encryption at rest for Amazon RDS for MySQL by using AWS KMS managed keys. Configure AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) SSL/TLS certificates for encryption in transit.",
    "B": "Configure encryption at rest for Amazon RDS for MySQL by using AWS KMS managed keys. Configure IPsec tunnels for encryption in transit.",
    "C": "Implement third-party application-level data encryption before storing data in Amazon RDS for MySQL. Configure AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) SSL/TLS certificates for encryption in transit.",
    "D": "Configure encryption at rest for Amazon RDS for MySQL by using AWS KMS managed keys. Configure a VPN connection to enable private connectivity to encrypt data in transit."
  },
  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": "RDS encryption at rest using KMS managed keys is straightforward to configure. SSL/TLS certificates for RDS connections provide encryption in transit with minimal overhead. This is the simplest approach compared to IPsec tunnels, VPNs, or third-party encryption."
