  "question": "A company hosts its web applications in the AWS Cloud. The company configures Elastic Load Balancers to use certificates that are imported into AWS Certificate Manager (ACM). The company's security team must be notified 30 days before the expiration of each certificate.\n\nWhat should a solutions architect recommend to meet this requirement?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Add a rule in ACM to publish a custom message to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic every day, starting 30 days before any certificate will expire.",
    "B": "Create an AWS Config rule that checks for certificates that will expire within 30 days. Configure Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) to invoke a custom alert by way of Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) when AWS Config reports a noncompliant resource.",
    "C": "Use AWS Trusted Advisor to check for certificates that will expire within 30 days. Create an Amazon CloudWatch alarm that is based on the Trusted Advisor metrics for check status changes. Configure the alarm to send a custom alert by way of Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS).",
    "D": "Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule to detect any certificates that will expire within 30 days. Configure the rule to invoke an AWS Lambda function. Configure the Lambda function to send a custom alert by way of Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS)."
  },
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": "AWS Config has a managed rule (acm-certificate-expiration-check) that checks for certificates expiring within a specified number of days. EventBridge can trigger on AWS Config compliance changes to send SNS notifications. ACM doesn't have built-in notification rules. Trusted Advisor certificate checks have limited configurability. EventBridge alone can't directly check certificate expiration."
