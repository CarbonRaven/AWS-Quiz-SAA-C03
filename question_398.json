  "question": "A company has a production web application in which users upload documents through a web interface or an API. As part of another evolution of the application, the company wants to add a new feature to process a queue of documents asynchronously.\n\nThe company needs to ensure that documents are processed at least once. The application already runs on Amazon EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group.\n\nA solutions architect must design a scalable and secure solution for the new feature.\n\nWhich solution meets these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Add an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Configure the application to add a message to the queue when a document is uploaded. Create a new Auto Scaling group of EC2 instances that are configured to process messages from the queue.",
    "B": "Add an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Configure the application to add a message to the queue when a document is uploaded. Configure the EC2 instances in the existing Auto Scaling group to process messages from the queue.",
    "C": "Add an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream. Configure the application to add a message to the stream when a document is uploaded. Configure the EC2 instances in the existing Auto Scaling group to process messages from the stream.",
    "D": "Add an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic. Configure the application to publish a message to the topic when a document is uploaded. Subscribe the EC2 instances in the existing Auto Scaling group to the topic to process messages."
  },
  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": "SQS provides at-least-once delivery guarantee and decouples document processing from upload. A separate Auto Scaling group allows independent scaling for processing workload. SQS visibility timeout prevents multiple instances processing the same message. SNS doesn't guarantee at-least-once processing. Kinesis Firehose is for streaming data to destinations, not message queuing. Using existing ASG doesn't allow independent scaling."
