  "question": "A solutions architect manages an analytics application. The application stores large amounts of semistructured data in an Amazon S3 bucket. The solutions architect wants to use parallel data processing to process the data more quickly. The solutions architect also wants to use information that is stored in an Amazon Redshift database to enrich the data.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Use Amazon Athena to process the S3 data. Use AWS Glue with the Amazon Redshift data to enrich the S3 data.",
    "B": "Use Amazon EMR to process the S3 data. Use Amazon EMR with the Amazon Redshift data to enrich the S3 data.",
    "C": "Use Amazon EMR to process the S3 data. Use Amazon Kinesis Data Streams to move the S3 data into Amazon Redshift so that the data can be enriched.",
    "D": "Use AWS Glue to process the S3 data. Use AWS Lake Formation with the Amazon Redshift data to enrich the S3 data."
  },
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": "Amazon EMR is designed for parallel data processing of large datasets and can directly integrate with both S3 and Redshift. EMR can process S3 data in parallel and use Redshift data for enrichment within the same processing framework."
