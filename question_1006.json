  "question": "A company uses AWS Systems Manager for routine management and patching of Amazon EC2 instances. The EC2 instances are in an IP address type target group behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB).\n\nNew security protocols require the company to remove EC2 instances from service during a patch. When the company attempts to follow the security protocol during the next patch, the company receives errors during the patching window.\n\nWhich combination of solutions will resolve the errors? (Choose two.)",
  "options": {
    "A": "Change the target type of the target group from IP address type to instance type.",
    "B": "Continue to use the existing Systems Manager document without changes because it is already optimized to handle instances that are in an IP address type target group behind an ALB.",
    "C": "Implement the AWSEC2-PatchLoadBalanacerInstance Systems Manager Automation document to manage the patching process.",
    "D": "Use Systems Manager Maintenance Windows to automatically remove the instances from service to patch the instances.",
    "E": "Configure Systems Manager State Manager to remove the instances from service and manage the patching schedule. Use ALB health checks to re-route traffic."
  },
  "correct_answer": ["C", "D"],
  "explanation": "The AWSEC2-PatchLoadBalanacerInstance Automation document is specifically designed to handle patching of instances behind load balancers by properly deregistering and re-registering them. Systems Manager Maintenance Windows provides the scheduling capability to automate the removal of instances from service during patching."
