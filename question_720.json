  "question": "A manufacturing company runs its report generation application on AWS. The application generates each report in about 20 minutes. The application is built as a monolith that runs on a single Amazon EC2 instance. The application requires frequent updates to its tightly coupled modules. The application becomes complex to maintain as the company adds new features.\n\nEach time the company patches a software module, the application experiences downtime. Report generation must restart from the beginning after any interruptions. The company wants to redesign the application so that the application can be flexible, scalable, and gradually improved. The company wants to minimize application downtime.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Run the application on AWS Lambda as a single function with maximum provisioned concurrency.",
    "B": "Run the application on Amazon EC2 Spot Instances as microservices with a Spot Fleet default allocation strategy.",
    "C": "Run the application on Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) as microservices with service auto scaling.",
    "D": "Run the application on AWS Elastic Beanstalk as a single application environment with an all-at-once deployment strategy."
  },
  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": "Amazon ECS with microservices architecture allows independent deployment and scaling of application components, minimizing downtime during updates. Service auto scaling provides flexibility and scalability. This approach supports gradual improvements without affecting the entire application."
