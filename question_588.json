  "question": "An ecommerce company wants a disaster recovery solution for its Amazon RDS DB instances that run Microsoft SQL Server Enterprise Edition. The company's current recovery point objective (RPO) and recovery time objective (RTO) are 24 hours.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Create a cross-Region read replica and promote the read replica to the primary instance.",
    "B": "Use AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) to create RDS cross-Region replication.",
    "C": "Use cross-Region replication every 24 hours to copy native backups to an Amazon S3 bucket.",
    "D": "Copy automatic snapshots to another Region every 24 hours."
  },
  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": "With 24-hour RPO/RTO, copying automatic snapshots to another Region every 24 hours is the most cost-effective DR solution. Cross-Region read replicas are not supported for RDS SQL Server. Snapshot copy provides simple, low-cost disaster recovery."
