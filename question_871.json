    "A": "Configure Amazon Cognito for authentication. Implement Lambda@Edge for authorization. Configure Amazon CloudFront to serve the web application globally.",
    "B": "Configure AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory for authentication. Implement AWS Lambda for authorization. Use an Application Load Balancer to serve the web application globally.",
    "C": "Configure Amazon Cognito for authentication. Implement AWS Lambda for authorization. Use Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration to serve the web application globally.",
    "D": "Configure AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory for authentication. Implement Lambda@Edge for authorization. Use AWS Elastic Beanstalk to serve the web application globally."
