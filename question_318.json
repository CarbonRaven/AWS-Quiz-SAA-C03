  "question": "A company recently migrated its entire IT environment to the AWS Cloud. The company discovers that users are provisioning oversized Amazon EC2 instances and modifying security group rules without using the appropriate change control process. A solutions architect must devise a strategy to track and audit these inventory and configuration changes.\n\nWhich actions should the solutions architect take to meet these requirements? (Choose two.)",
  "options": {
    "A": "Enable AWS CloudTrail and use it for auditing.",
    "B": "Use data lifecycle policies for the Amazon EC2 instances.",
    "C": "Enable AWS Trusted Advisor and reference the security dashboard.",
    "D": "Enable AWS Config and create rules for auditing and compliance purposes.",
    "E": "Restore previous resource configurations with an AWS CloudFormation template."
  },
  "correct_answer": ["A", "D"],
  "explanation": "CloudTrail (A) tracks API calls and user activity for auditing who made changes. AWS Config (D) tracks resource configurations and can evaluate compliance against rules. Data lifecycle policies don't track changes. Trusted Advisor provides recommendations, not change tracking. CloudFormation doesn't audit changes."
