  "question": "A company hosts multiple applications on AWS for different product lines. The applications use different compute resources, including Amazon EC2 instances and Application Load Balancers. The applications run in different AWS accounts under the same organization in AWS Organizations across multiple AWS Regions. Teams for each product line have tagged each compute resource in the individual accounts.\n\nThe company wants more details about the cost for each product line from the consolidated billing feature in Organizations.\n\nWhich combination of steps will meet these requirements? (Choose two.)",
  "options": {
    "A": "Select a specific AWS generated tag in the AWS Billing console.",
    "B": "Select a specific user-defined tag in the AWS Billing console.",
    "C": "Select a specific user-defined tag in the AWS Resource Groups console.",
    "D": "Activate the selected tag from each AWS account.",
    "E": "Activate the selected tag from the Organizations management account."
  },
  "correct_answer": ["B", "E"],
  "explanation": "To use cost allocation tags for billing, you must select user-defined tags in the AWS Billing console and activate them from the Organizations management account. This allows consolidated billing to track costs by product line tags across all member accounts."
