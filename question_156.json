  "question": "A company produces batch data that comes from different databases. The company also produces live stream data from network sensors and application APIs. The company needs to consolidate all the data into one place for business analytics. The company needs to process the incoming data and then stage the data in different Amazon S3 buckets. Teams will later run one-time queries and import the data into a business intelligence tool to show key performance indicators (KPIs).\nWhich combination of steps will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead? (Choose two.)",
  "options": {
    "A": "Use Amazon Athena for one-time queries. Use Amazon QuickSight to create dashboards for KPIs.",
    "B": "Use Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics for one-time queries. Use Amazon QuickSight to create dashboards for KPIs.",
    "C": "Create custom AWS Lambda functions to move the individual records from the databases to an Amazon Redshift cluster.",
    "D": "Use an AWS Glue extract, transform, and load (ETL) job to convert the data into JSON format. Load the data into multiple Amazon OpenSearch Service (Amazon Elasticsearch Service) clusters.",
    "E": "Use blueprints in AWS Lake Formation to identify the data that can be ingested into a data lake. Use AWS Glue to crawl the source, extract the data, and load the data into Amazon S3 in Apache Parquet format."
  },
  "correct_answer": ["A", "E"],
  "explanation": "Lake Formation with Glue provides a managed data lake solution with minimal overhead. Glue crawlers automatically discover and catalog data. Athena provides serverless SQL queries on S3 data. QuickSight creates BI dashboards. This combination requires the least operational overhead."
