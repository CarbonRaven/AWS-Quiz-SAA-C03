  "question": "The DNS provider that hosts a company's domain name records is experiencing outages that cause service disruption for a website running on AWS. The company needs to migrate to a more resilient managed DNS service and wants the service to run on AWS.\n\nWhat should a solutions architect do to rapidly migrate the DNS hosting service?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Create an Amazon Route 53 public hosted zone for the domain name. Import the zone file containing the domain records hosted by the previous provider.",
    "B": "Create an Amazon Route 53 private hosted zone for the domain name. Import the zone file containing the domain records hosted by the previous provider.",
    "C": "Create a Simple AD directory in AWS. Enable zone transfer between the DNS provider and AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory for the domain records.",
    "D": "Create an Amazon Route 53 Resolver inbound endpoint in the VPC. Specify the IP addresses that the provider's DNS will forward DNS queries to. Configure the provider's DNS to forward DNS queries for the domain to the IP addresses that are specified in the inbound endpoint."
  },
  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": "Route 53 public hosted zones host DNS records for domains accessible over the internet. Importing the zone file from the previous provider quickly migrates all existing DNS records. Route 53 is highly resilient with global anycast DNS infrastructure."
