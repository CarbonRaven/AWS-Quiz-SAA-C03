  "question": "An application that is hosted on Amazon EC2 instances needs to access an Amazon S3 bucket. Traffic must not traverse the internet.\n\nHow should a solutions architect configure access to meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Create a private hosted zone by using Amazon Route 53.",
    "B": "Set up a gateway VPC endpoint for Amazon S3 in the VPC.",
    "C": "Configure the EC2 instances to use a NAT gateway to access the S3 bucket.",
    "D": "Establish an AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection between the VPC and the S3 bucket."
  },
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": "Gateway VPC endpoints for S3 allow traffic to flow directly from the VPC to S3 over AWS's private network, never traversing the internet. Gateway endpoints are free and don't require NAT. Route 53 private hosted zones don't control traffic routing to S3. NAT gateway routes traffic through the internet. VPN connections are for on-premises connectivity, not S3 access."
