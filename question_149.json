  "question": "A company has a service that produces event data. The company wants to use AWS to process the event data as it is received. The data is written in a specific order that must be maintained throughout processing. The company wants to implement a solution that minimizes operational overhead.\nHow should a solutions architect accomplish this?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Create an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) FIFO queue to hold messages. Set up an AWS Lambda function to process messages from the queue.",
    "B": "Create an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic to deliver notifications containing payloads to process. Configure an AWS Lambda function as a subscriber.",
    "C": "Create an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) standard queue to hold messages. Set up an AWS Lambda function to process messages from the queue independently.",
    "D": "Create an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic to deliver notifications containing payloads to process. Configure an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue as a subscriber."
  },
  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": "SQS FIFO queues guarantee message ordering (First-In-First-Out), which is required to maintain the specific order. Lambda provides serverless processing with minimal operational overhead. Standard SQS queues don't guarantee ordering. SNS doesn't preserve message order."
}
