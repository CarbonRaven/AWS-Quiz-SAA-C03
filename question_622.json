  "question": "A company is creating a new web application for its subscribers. The application will consist of a static single page and a persistent database layer. The application will have millions of users for 4 hours in the morning, but the application will have only a few thousand users during the rest of the day. The company's data architects have requested the ability to rapidly evolve their schema.\n\nWhich solutions will meet these requirements and provide the MOST scalability? (Choose two.)",
  "options": {
    "A": "Deploy Amazon DynamoDB as the database solution. Provision on-demand capacity.",
    "B": "Deploy Amazon Aurora as the database solution. Choose the serverless DB engine mode.",
    "C": "Deploy Amazon DynamoDB as the database solution. Ensure that DynamoDB auto scaling is enabled.",
    "D": "Deploy the static content into an Amazon S3 bucket. Provision an Amazon CloudFront distribution with the S3 bucket as the origin.",
    "E": "Deploy the web servers for static content across a fleet of Amazon EC2 instances in Auto Scaling groups. Configure the instances to periodically refresh the content from an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) volume."
  },
  "correct_answer": ["A", "D"],
  "explanation": "DynamoDB with on-demand capacity scales automatically to handle millions of users during peak times and scales down during low usage, with flexible schema. S3 with CloudFront is the most scalable and cost-effective solution for serving static content to millions of users."
