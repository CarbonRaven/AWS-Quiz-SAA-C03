  "question": "A company collects data from a large number of participants who use wearable devices. The company stores the data in an Amazon DynamoDB table and uses applications to analyze the data. The data workload is constant and predictable. The company wants to stay at or below its forecasted budget for DynamoDB.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Use provisioned mode and DynamoDB Standard-Infrequent Access (DynamoDB Standard-IA). Reserve capacity for the forecasted workload.",
    "B": "Use provisioned mode. Specify the read capacity units (RCUs) and write capacity units (WCUs).",
    "C": "Use on-demand mode. Set the read capacity units (RCUs) and write capacity units (WCUs) high enough to accommodate changes in the workload.",
    "D": "Use on-demand mode. Specify the read capacity units (RCUs) and write capacity units (WCUs) with reserved capacity."
  },
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": "For constant, predictable workloads, provisioned mode with specified RCUs/WCUs is most cost-effective. On-demand mode is more expensive for predictable workloads. Standard-IA is for infrequently accessed data, not constant workloads. On-demand doesn't allow specifying capacity - it auto-scales."
