  "question": "A company is developing an application to support customer demands. The company wants to deploy the application on multiple Amazon EC2 Nitro-based instances within the same Availability Zone. The company also wants to give the application the ability to write to multiple block storage volumes in multiple EC2 Nitro-based instances simultaneously to achieve higher application availability.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Use General Purpose SSD (gp3) EBS volumes with Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) Multi-Attach",
    "B": "Use Throughput Optimized HDD (st1) EBS volumes with Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) Multi-Attach",
    "C": "Use Provisioned IOPS SSD (io2) EBS volumes with Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) Multi-Attach",
    "D": "Use General Purpose SSD (gp2) EBS volumes with Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) Multi-Attach"
  },
  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": "EBS Multi-Attach is only supported on Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1 and io2) volumes. It allows a single EBS volume to be attached to multiple Nitro-based EC2 instances in the same Availability Zone. gp2, gp3, and st1 volumes do not support Multi-Attach."
