  "question": "A company has multiple VPCs across AWS Regions to support and run workloads that are isolated from workloads in other Regions. Because of a recent application launch requirement, the company's VPCs must communicate with all other VPCs across all Regions.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST amount of administrative effort?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Use VPC peering to manage VPC communication in a single Region. Use VPC peering across Regions to manage VPC communications.",
    "B": "Use AWS Direct Connect gateways across all Regions to connect VPCs across regions and manage VPC communications.",
    "C": "Use AWS Transit Gateway to manage VPC communication in a single Region and Transit Gateway peering across Regions to manage VPC communications.",
    "D": "Use AWS PrivateLink across all Regions to connect VPCs across Regions and manage VPC communications"
  },
  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": "Transit Gateway provides a hub-and-spoke model for connecting VPCs within a Region, and Transit Gateway peering enables cross-Region connectivity. This is more scalable than VPC peering for multiple VPCs. Direct Connect is for on-premises connectivity. PrivateLink is for service endpoints."
