  "question": "A company has an application that uses an Amazon DynamoDB table for storage. A solutions architect discovers that many requests to the table are not returning the latest data. The company's users have not reported any other issues with database performance. Latency is in an acceptable range.\n\nWhich design change should the solutions architect recommend?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Add read replicas to the table.",
    "B": "Use a global secondary index (GSI).",
    "C": "Request strongly consistent reads for the table.",
    "D": "Request eventually consistent reads for the table."
  },
  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": "DynamoDB uses eventually consistent reads by default, which may not return the latest data. Strongly consistent reads return results that reflect all writes that received a successful response prior to the read, ensuring the latest data is returned."
}
