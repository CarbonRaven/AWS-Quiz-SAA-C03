  "question": "A company is expanding a secure on-premises network to the AWS Cloud by using an AWS Direct Connect connection. The on-premises network has no direct internet access. An application that runs on the on-premises network needs to use an Amazon S3 bucket.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Create a public virtual interface (VIF). Route the AWS traffic over the public VIF.",
    "B": "Create a VPC and a NAT gateway. Route the AWS traffic from the on-premises network to the NAT gateway.",
    "C": "Create a VPC and an Amazon S3 interface endpoint. Route the AWS traffic from the on-premises network to the S3 interface endpoint.",
    "D": "Create a VPC peering connection between the on-premises network and Direct Connect. Route the AWS traffic over the peering connection."
  },
  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": "An S3 interface endpoint (PrivateLink) with Direct Connect private VIF provides secure private access to S3 without internet access. This is more cost-effective than public VIF for ongoing data transfer and keeps traffic private."
