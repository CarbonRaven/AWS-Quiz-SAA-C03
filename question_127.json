  "question": "A media company is evaluating the possibility of moving its systems to the AWS Cloud. The company needs at least 10 TB of storage with the maximum possible I/O performance for video processing, 300 TB of very durable storage for storing media content, and 900 TB of storage to meet requirements for archival media that is not in use anymore.\nWhich set of services should a solutions architect recommend to meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Amazon EBS for maximum performance, Amazon S3 for durable data storage, and Amazon S3 Glacier for archival storage",
    "B": "Amazon EBS for maximum performance, Amazon EFS for durable data storage, and Amazon S3 Glacier for archival storage",
    "C": "Amazon EC2 instance store for maximum performance, Amazon EFS for durable data storage, and Amazon S3 for archival storage",
    "D": "Amazon EC2 instance store for maximum performance, Amazon S3 for durable data storage, and Amazon S3 Glacier for archival storage"
  },
  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": "EC2 instance store provides the highest I/O performance for video processing (ephemeral but fastest). S3 provides highly durable storage (11 9s durability) for media content. S3 Glacier is the most cost-effective for archival storage that is rarely accessed."
