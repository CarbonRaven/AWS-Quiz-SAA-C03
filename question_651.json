  "question": "A company stores a large volume of image files in an Amazon S3 bucket. The images need to be readily available for the first 180 days. The images are infrequently accessed for the next 180 days. After 360 days, the images need to be archived but must be available instantly upon request. After 5 years, only auditors can access the images. The auditors must be able to retrieve the images within 12 hours. The images cannot be lost during this process.\n\nA developer will use S3 Standard storage for the first 180 days. The developer needs to configure an S3 Lifecycle rule.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Transition the objects to S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA) after 180 days. S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval after 360 days, and S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 5 years.",
    "B": "Transition the objects to S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA) after 180 days. S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval after 360 days, and S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 5 years.",
    "C": "Transition the objects to S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) after 180 days, S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval after 360 days, and S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 5 years.",
    "D": "Transition the objects to S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) after 180 days, S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval after 360 days, and S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 5 years."
  },
  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": "S3 Standard-IA provides durability across multiple AZs (images cannot be lost), Glacier Instant Retrieval provides instant access after 360 days, and Glacier Deep Archive meets the 12-hour retrieval requirement for auditors after 5 years. One Zone-IA is not suitable as data loss is not acceptable."
