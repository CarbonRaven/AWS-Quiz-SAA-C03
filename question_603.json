  "question": "A company recently migrated to the AWS Cloud. The company wants a serverless solution for large-scale parallel on-demand processing of a semistructured dataset. The data consists of logs, media files, sales transactions, and IoT sensor data that is stored in Amazon S3. The company wants the solution to process thousands of items in the dataset in parallel.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements with the MOST operational efficiency?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Use the AWS Step Functions Map state in Inline mode to process the data in parallel.",
    "B": "Use the AWS Step Functions Map state in Distributed mode to process the data in parallel.",
    "C": "Use AWS Glue to process the data in parallel.",
    "D": "Use several AWS Lambda functions to process the data in parallel."
  },
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": "AWS Step Functions Distributed Map state is designed for large-scale parallel processing of thousands of items. Unlike Inline mode (limited to 40 concurrent iterations), Distributed mode can handle up to 10,000 parallel child executions, making it ideal for processing large datasets."
