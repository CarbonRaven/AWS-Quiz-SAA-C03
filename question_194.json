  "question": "A company needs to run a critical application on AWS. The company needs to use Amazon EC2 for the application's database. The database must be highly available and must fail over automatically if a disruptive event occurs.\nWhich solution will meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Launch two EC2 instances, each in a different Availability Zone in the same AWS Region. Install the database on both EC2 instances. Configure the EC2 instances as a cluster. Set up database replication.",
    "B": "Launch an EC2 instance in an Availability Zone. Install the database on the EC2 instance. Use an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) to back up the data. Use AWS CloudFormation to automate provisioning of the EC2 instance if a disruptive event occurs.",
    "C": "Launch two EC2 instances, each in a different AWS Region. Install the database on both EC2 instances. Set up database replication. Fail over the database to a second Region.",
    "D": "Launch an EC2 instance in an Availability Zone. Install the database on the EC2 instance. Use an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) to back up the data. Use EC2 automatic recovery to recover the instance if a disruptive event occurs."
  },
  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": "Running database instances in two AZs with clustering and replication provides high availability with automatic failover within the same region. This is the standard approach for self-managed databases on EC2. Multi-region adds complexity and latency. AMI backups don't provide automatic failover."
