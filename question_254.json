  "question": "A company is reviewing a recent migration of a three-tier application to a VPC. The security team discovers that the principle of least privilege is not being applied to Amazon EC2 security group ingress and egress rules between the application tiers.\n\nWhat should a solutions architect do to correct this issue?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Create security group rules using the instance ID as the source or destination.",
    "B": "Create security group rules using the security group ID as the source or destination.",
    "C": "Create security group rules using the VPC CIDR blocks as the source or destination.",
    "D": "Create security group rules using the subnet CIDR blocks as the source or destination."
  },
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": "Using security group IDs as source/destination implements least privilege by allowing only traffic from instances in specific security groups. This is more secure than CIDR blocks which allow any IP in that range. Instance IDs are too granular and don't scale with Auto Scaling. Security group references automatically adapt as instances are added/removed."
}
