  "question": "A company has primary and secondary data centers that are 500 miles (804.7 km) apart and interconnected with high-speed fiber-optic cable. The company needs a highly available and secure network connection between its data centers and a VPC on AWS for a mission-critical workload. A solutions architect must choose a connection solution that provides maximum resiliency.\n\nWhich solution meets these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Two AWS Direct Connect connections from the primary data center terminating at two Direct Connect locations on two separate devices",
    "B": "A single AWS Direct Connect connection from each of the primary and secondary data centers terminating at one Direct Connect location on the same device",
    "C": "Two AWS Direct Connect connections from each of the primary and secondary data centers terminating at two Direct Connect locations on two separate devices",
    "D": "A single AWS Direct Connect connection from each of the primary and secondary data centers terminating at one Direct Connect location on two separate devices"
  },
  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": "Maximum resiliency requires connections from multiple data centers to multiple Direct Connect locations on separate devices, providing redundancy at every level (data center, connection, location, and device)."
}
