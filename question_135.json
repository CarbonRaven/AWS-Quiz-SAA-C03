  "question": "A company runs workloads on AWS. The company needs to connect to a service from an external provider. The service is hosted in the provider's VPC. According to the company's security team, the connectivity must be private and must be restricted to the target service. The connection must be initiated only from the company's VPC.\nWhich solution will meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Create a VPC peering connection between the company's VPC and the provider's VPC. Update the route table to connect to the target service.",
    "B": "Ask the provider to create a virtual private gateway in its VPC. Use AWS PrivateLink to connect to the target service.",
    "C": "Create a NAT gateway in a public subnet of the company's VPC. Update the route table to connect to the target service.",
    "D": "Ask the provider to create a VPC endpoint for the target service. Use AWS PrivateLink to connect to the target service."
  },
  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": "AWS PrivateLink provides private connectivity between VPCs without exposing traffic to the public internet. The provider creates an endpoint service, and the company creates an interface endpoint. This restricts access to the specific service and keeps traffic private."
}
