  "question": "A company hosts an application in a private subnet. The company has already integrated the application with Amazon Cognito. The company uses an Amazon Cognito user pool to authenticate users.\n\nThe company needs to modify the application so the application can securely store user documents in an Amazon S3 bucket.\n\nWhich combination of steps will securely integrate Amazon S3 with the application? (Choose two.)",
  "options": {
    "A": "Create an Amazon Cognito identity pool to generate secure Amazon S3 access tokens for users when they successfully log in.",
    "B": "Use the existing Amazon Cognito user pool to generate Amazon S3 access tokens for users when they successfully log in.",
    "C": "Create an Amazon S3 VPC endpoint in the same VPC where the company hosts the application.",
    "D": "Create a NAT gateway in the VPC where the company hosts the application. Assign a policy to the S3 bucket to deny any request that is not initiated from Amazon Cognito.",
    "E": "Attach a policy to the S3 bucket that allows access only from the users' IP addresses."
  },
  "correct_answer": ["A", "C"],
  "explanation": "Cognito identity pools (federated identities) provide temporary AWS credentials for accessing AWS services like S3, while user pools only handle authentication. An S3 VPC endpoint allows the application in the private subnet to securely access S3 without requiring internet access through a NAT gateway."
