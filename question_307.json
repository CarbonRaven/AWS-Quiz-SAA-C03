  "question": "A company that primarily runs its application servers on premises has decided to migrate to AWS. The company wants to minimize its need to scale its Internet Small Computer Systems Interface (iSCSI) storage on premises. The company wants only its recently accessed data to remain stored locally.\n\nWhich AWS solution should the company use to meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Amazon S3 File Gateway",
    "B": "AWS Storage Gateway Tape Gateway",
    "C": "AWS Storage Gateway Volume Gateway stored volumes",
    "D": "AWS Storage Gateway Volume Gateway cached volumes"
  },
  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": "Volume Gateway cached volumes store primary data in S3 while caching frequently accessed data locally. This minimizes on-premises storage needs while keeping recent data local. Stored volumes keep all data locally. S3 File Gateway is for NFS/SMB, not iSCSI. Tape Gateway is for backup archival."
