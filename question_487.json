  "question": "A company seeks a storage solution for its application. The solution must be highly available and scalable. The solution also must function as a file system, be mountable by multiple Linux instances in AWS and on premises through native protocols, and have no minimum size requirements. The company has set up a Site-to-Site VPN for access from its on-premises network to its VPC.\n\nWhich storage solution meets these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Amazon FSx Multi-AZ deployments",
    "B": "Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) Multi-Attach volumes",
    "C": "Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) with multiple mount targets",
    "D": "Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) with a single mount target and multiple access points"
  },
  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": "Amazon EFS is a fully managed NFS file system that's highly available, scalable, supports mounting by multiple Linux instances, works with on-premises via VPN, and has no minimum size requirements. Multiple mount targets provide availability across AZs. EBS is block storage. FSx for Windows uses SMB, not native Linux protocols."
