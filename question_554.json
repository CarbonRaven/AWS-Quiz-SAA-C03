  "question": "A company's SAP application has a backend SQL Server database in an on-premises environment. The company wants to migrate its on-premises application and database server to AWS. The company needs an instance type that meets the high demands of its SAP database. On-premises performance data shows that both the SAP application and the database have high memory utilization.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Use the compute optimized instance family for the application. Use the memory optimized instance family for the database.",
    "B": "Use the storage optimized instance family for both the application and the database.",
    "C": "Use the memory optimized instance family for both the application and the database.",
    "D": "Use the high performance computing (HPC) optimized instance family for the application. Use the memory optimized instance family for the database."
  },
  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": "Since both the SAP application and database have high memory utilization, memory optimized instances (R-series, X-series) are the best fit for both workloads. SAP workloads typically require high memory capacity."
}
