  "question": "A company hosts a monolithic web application on an Amazon EC2 instance. Application users have recently reported poor performance at specific times. Analysis of Amazon CloudWatch metrics shows that CPU utilization is 100% during the periods of poor performance.\n\nThe company wants to resolve this performance issue and improve application availability.\n\nWhich combination of steps will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively? (Choose two.)",
  "options": {
    "A": "Use AWS Compute Optimizer to obtain a recommendation for an instance type to scale vertically.",
    "B": "Create an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) from the web server. Reference the AMI in a new launch template.",
    "C": "Create an Auto Scaling group and an Application Load Balancer to scale vertically.",
    "D": "Use AWS Compute Optimizer to obtain a recommendation for an instance type to scale horizontally.",
    "E": "Create an Auto Scaling group and an Application Load Balancer to scale horizontally."
  },
  "correct_answer": ["A", "E"],
  "explanation": "Compute Optimizer provides right-sizing recommendations. Auto Scaling with ALB enables horizontal scaling to handle peak loads and improves availability. Horizontal scaling with ASG requires knowing the right instance type."
