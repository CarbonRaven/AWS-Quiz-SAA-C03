  "question_text": "A company uses an Amazon RDS for MySQL instance. To prepare for end-of-year processing, the company added a read replica to accommodate extra read-only queries from the company's reporting tool. The read replica CPU usage was 60% and the primary instance CPU usage was 60%. After end-of-year activities are complete, the read replica has a constant 25% CPU usage. The primary instance still has a constant 60% CPU usage. The company wants to rightsize the database and still provide enough performance for future growth. Which solution will meet these requirements?",

    "A": "Delete the read replica Do not make changes to the primary instance",

    "D": "Delete the read replica Resize the primary instance to a larger instance"
