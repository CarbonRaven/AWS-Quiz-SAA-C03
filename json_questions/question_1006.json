When the company attempts to follow the security protocol during the next patch, the company receives errors during the patching window. Which combination of solutions will resolve the errors? (Choose two.)",

    "C": "Implement the AWSEC2-PatchLoadBalanacerInstance Systems Manager Automation document to manage the patching process.",
    "D": "Use Systems Manager Maintenance Windows to automatically remove the instances from service to patch the instances.",
    "E": "Configure Systems Manager State Manager to remove the instances from service and manage the patching schedule. Use ALB health checks to re-route traffic."
