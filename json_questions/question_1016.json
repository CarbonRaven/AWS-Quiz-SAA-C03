  "question_text": "A company runs an application in a private subnet behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB) in a VPC. The VPC has a NAT gateway and an internet gateway.

Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Configure an S3 interface endpoint. Create a security group that allows outbound traffic to Amazon S3.",
    "B": "Configure an S3 gateway endpoint. Update the VPC route table to use the endpoint.",
    "C": "Configure an S3 bucket policy to allow traffic from the Elastic IP address that is assigned to the NAT gateway.",
    "D": "Create a second NAT gateway in the same subnet where the legacy application is deployed. Update the VPC route table to use the second NAT gateway."
