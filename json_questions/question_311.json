Quotes must be separated by quote type, must be responded to within 24 hours, and must not get lost. The solution must maximize operational efficiency and must minimize maintenance.\n\nWhich solution meets these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Create multiple Amazon Kinesis data streams based on the quote type. Configure the web application to send messages to the proper data stream. Configure each backend group of application servers to use the Kinesis Client Library (KCL) to pool messages from its own data stream.",

    "C": "Create a single Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic. Subscribe Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queues to the SNS topic. Configure SNS message filtering to publish messages to the proper SQS queue based on the quote type. Configure each backend application server to use its own SQS queue.",
    "D": "Create multiple Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery streams based on the quote type to deliver data streams to an Amazon OpenSearch Service cluster. Configure the application to send messages to the proper delivery stream. Configure each backend group of application servers to search for the messages from OpenSearch Service and process them accordingly."
