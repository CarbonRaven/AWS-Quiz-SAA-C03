  "question": "A company maintains a searchable repository of items on its website. The data is stored in an Amazon RDS for MySQL database table that contains more than 10 million rows. The database has 2 TB of General Purpose SSD storage. There are millions of updates against this data every day through the company's website.\nThe company has noticed that some insert operations are taking 10 seconds or longer. The company has determined that the database storage performance is the problem.\nWhich solution addresses this performance issue?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Change the storage type to Provisioned IOPS SSD.",
    "B": "Change the DB instance to a memory optimized instance class.",
    "C": "Change the DB instance to a burstable performance instance class.",
    "D": "Enable Multi-AZ RDS read replicas with MySQL native asynchronous replication."
  },
  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": "Since the problem is identified as storage performance, Provisioned IOPS SSD provides consistent, high-performance I/O for write-intensive workloads, unlike General Purpose SSD which can have variable performance."
}
