  "question": "A company must migrate 20 TB of data from a data center to the AWS Cloud within 30 days. The company's network bandwidth is limited to 15 Mbps and cannot exceed 70% utilization.\n\nWhat should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Use AWS Snowball.",
    "B": "Use AWS DataSync.",
    "C": "Use a secure VPN connection.",
    "D": "Use Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration."
  },
  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": "At 15 Mbps with 70% utilization (~10.5 Mbps), transferring 20 TB would take approximately 176 days - exceeding the 30-day requirement. AWS Snowball physically ships data, bypassing network limitations. DataSync, VPN, and Transfer Acceleration all rely on the limited network bandwidth."
