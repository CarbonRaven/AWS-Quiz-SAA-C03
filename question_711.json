  "question": "An ecommerce company runs its application on AWS. The application uses an Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL cluster in Multi-AZ mode for the underlying database. During a recent promotional campaign, the application experienced heavy read load and write load. Users experienced timeout issues when they attempted to access the application.\n\nA solutions architect needs to make the application architecture more scalable and highly available.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST downtime?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Create an Amazon EventBridge rule that has the Aurora cluster as a source. Create an AWS Lambda function to log the state change events of the Aurora cluster. Add the Lambda function as a target for the EventBridge rule. Add additional reader nodes to fail over to.",
    "B": "Modify the Aurora cluster and activate the zero-downtime restart (ZDR) feature. Use Database Activity Streams on the cluster to track the cluster status.",
    "C": "Add additional reader instances to the Aurora cluster. Create an Amazon RDS Proxy target group for the Aurora cluster.",
    "D": "Create an Amazon ElastiCache for Redis cache. Replicate data from the Aurora cluster to Redis by using AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) with a write-around approach."
  },
  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": "Adding Aurora read replicas handles increased read load, while RDS Proxy improves connection management, reduces failover times, and handles connection pooling. This solution addresses both scalability and availability with minimal downtime impact."
