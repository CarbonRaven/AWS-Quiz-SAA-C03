  "question": "A company offers a food delivery service that is growing rapidly. Because of the growth, the company's order processing system is experiencing scaling problems during peak traffic hours. The current architecture includes:\n• A group of Amazon EC2 instances that run in an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group to collect orders from the application\n• Another group of EC2 instances that run in an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group to fulfill orders\nThe order collection process occurs quickly, but the order fulfillment process can take longer. Data must not be lost because of a scaling event.\nA solutions architect must ensure that the order collection process and the order fulfillment process can both scale properly during peak traffic hours. The solution must optimize utilization of the company's AWS resources.\nWhich solution meets these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Use Amazon CloudWatch metrics to monitor the CPU of each instance in the Auto Scaling groups. Configure each Auto Scaling group's minimum capacity according to peak workload values.",
    "B": "Use Amazon CloudWatch metrics to monitor the CPU of each instance in the Auto Scaling groups. Configure a CloudWatch alarm to invoke an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic that creates additional Auto Scaling groups on demand.",
    "C": "Provision two Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queues: one for order collection and another for order fulfillment. Configure the EC2 instances to poll their respective queue. Scale the Auto Scaling groups based on notifications that the queues send.",
    "D": "Provision two Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queues: one for order collection and another for order fulfillment. Configure the EC2 instances to poll their respective queue. Create a metric based on a backlog per instance calculation. Scale the Auto Scaling groups based on this metric."
  },
  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": "SQS queues decouple order collection from fulfillment, preventing data loss during scaling. Backlog per instance metric (ApproximateNumberOfMessages / number of instances) is the recommended approach for scaling based on queue depth, ensuring optimal resource utilization."
