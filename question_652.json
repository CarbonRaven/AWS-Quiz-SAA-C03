  "question": "A company has a large data workload that runs for 6 hours each day. The company cannot lose any data while the process is running. A solutions architect is designing an Amazon EMR cluster configuration to support this critical data workload.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Configure a long-running cluster that runs the primary node and core nodes on On-Demand Instances and the task nodes on Spot Instances.",
    "B": "Configure a transient cluster that runs the primary node and core nodes on On-Demand Instances and the task nodes on Spot Instances.",
    "C": "Configure a transient cluster that runs the primary node on an On-Demand Instance and the core nodes and task nodes on Spot Instances.",
    "D": "Configure a long-running cluster that runs the primary node on an On-Demand Instance, the core nodes on Spot Instances, and the task nodes on Spot Instances."
  },
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": "A transient cluster is more cost-effective for workloads that run for a specific duration (6 hours daily). Primary and core nodes should use On-Demand Instances to prevent data loss, while task nodes can use Spot Instances as they only process data and don't store it."
}
