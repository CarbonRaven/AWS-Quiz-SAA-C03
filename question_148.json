  "question": "A company has a data ingestion workflow that includes the following components:\nAn Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic that receives notifications about new data deliveries\nAn AWS Lambda function that processes and stores the data\nThe ingestion workflow occasionally fails because of network connectivity issues. When failure occurs, the corresponding data is not ingested unless the company manually reruns the job.\nWhat should a solutions architect do to ensure that all notifications are eventually processed?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Configure the Lambda function for deployment across multiple Availability Zones.",
    "B": "Modify the Lambda function's configuration to increase the CPU and memory allocations for the function.",
    "C": "Configure the SNS topic's retry strategy to increase both the number of retries and the wait time between retries.",
    "D": "Configure an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue as the on-failure destination. Modify the Lambda function to process messages in the queue."
  },
  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": "SQS as a dead-letter queue (on-failure destination) captures failed invocations. The Lambda function can then process these failed messages from SQS, ensuring eventual processing. This handles transient network failures without manual intervention."
}
