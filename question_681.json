  "question": "A company uses Amazon EC2 instances and stores data on Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes. The company must ensure that all data is encrypted at rest by using AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS). The company must be able to control rotation of the encryption keys.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Create a customer managed key. Use the key to encrypt the EBS volumes.",
    "B": "Use an AWS managed key to encrypt the EBS volumes. Use the key to configure automatic key rotation.",
    "C": "Create an external KMS key with imported key material. Use the key to encrypt the EBS volumes.",
    "D": "Use an AWS owned key to encrypt the EBS volumes."
  },
  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": "Customer managed keys provide control over key rotation (can be enabled/disabled and configured for annual rotation). AWS managed keys rotate automatically without user control. External keys with imported material require manual rotation with more overhead. AWS owned keys offer no control."
}
