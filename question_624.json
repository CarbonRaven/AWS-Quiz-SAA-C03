  "question": "A company wants to provide users with access to AWS resources. The company has 1,500 users and manages their access to on-premises resources through Active Directory user groups on the corporate network. However, the company does not want users to have to maintain another identity to access the resources. A solutions architect must manage user access to the AWS resources while preserving access to the on-premises resources.\n\nWhat should the solutions architect do to meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Create an IAM user for each user in the company. Attach the appropriate policies to each user.",
    "B": "Use Amazon Cognito with an Active Directory user pool. Create roles with the appropriate policies attached.",
    "C": "Define cross-account roles with the appropriate policies attached. Map the roles to the Active Directory groups.",
    "D": "Configure Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0-based federation. Create roles with the appropriate policies attached. Map the roles to the Active Directory groups."
  },
  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": "SAML 2.0-based federation allows users to authenticate with their existing Active Directory credentials and assume IAM roles mapped to their AD groups. This eliminates the need for separate AWS identities while leveraging existing identity management."
}
