  "question": "A company provides an API interface to customers so the customers can retrieve their financial information. The company expects a larger number of requests during peak usage times of the year.\n\nThe company requires the API to respond consistently with low latency to ensure customer satisfaction. The company needs to provide a compute host for the API.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Use an Application Load Balancer and Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS).",
    "B": "Use Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda functions with provisioned concurrency.",
    "C": "Use an Application Load Balancer and an Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) cluster.",
    "D": "Use Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda functions with reserved concurrency."
  },
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": "API Gateway with Lambda provides a serverless, low-overhead solution. Provisioned concurrency eliminates cold starts, ensuring consistent low latency during peak times. Reserved concurrency limits the number of concurrent executions but doesn't prevent cold starts like provisioned concurrency does."
