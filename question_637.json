  "question": "A solutions architect is designing a new service behind Amazon API Gateway. The request patterns for the service will be unpredictable and can change suddenly from 0 requests to over 500 per second. The total size of the data that needs to be persisted in a backend database is currently less than 1 GB with unpredictable future growth. Data can be queried using simple key-value requests.\n\nWhich combination of AWS services would meet these requirements? (Choose two.)",
  "options": {
    "A": "AWS Fargate",
    "B": "AWS Lambda",
    "C": "Amazon DynamoDB",
    "D": "Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling",
    "E": "MySQL-compatible Amazon Aurora"
  },
  "correct_answer": ["B", "C"],
  "explanation": "Lambda automatically scales from 0 to handle sudden traffic spikes without provisioning servers. DynamoDB is ideal for key-value queries with automatic scaling and handles unpredictable workloads efficiently. Both are serverless and scale to zero when not in use."
