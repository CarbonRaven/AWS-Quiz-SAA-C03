  "question": "A company is migrating a three-tier application to AWS. The application requires a MySQL database. In the past, the application users reported poor application performance when creating new entries. These performance issues were caused by users generating different real-time reports from the application during working hours.\n\nWhich solution will improve the performance of the application when it is moved to AWS?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Import the data into an Amazon DynamoDB table with provisioned capacity. Refactor the application to use DynamoDB for reports.",
    "B": "Create the database on a compute optimized Amazon EC2 instance. Ensure compute resources exceed the on-premises database.",
    "C": "Create an Amazon Aurora MySQL Multi-AZ DB cluster with multiple read replicas. Configure the application to use the reader endpoint for reports.",
    "D": "Create an Amazon Aurora MySQL Multi-AZ DB cluster. Configure the application to use the backup instance of the cluster as an endpoint for the reports."
  },
  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": "Aurora MySQL with read replicas allows separating read traffic (reports) from write traffic (creating entries). Using the reader endpoint for reports offloads read operations from the primary instance, improving write performance."
}
