  "question": "A solutions architect must migrate a Windows Internet Information Services (IIS) web application to AWS. The application currently relies on a file share hosted in the user's on-premises network-attached storage (NAS). The solutions architect has proposed migrating the IIS web servers to Amazon EC2 instances in multiple Availability Zones that are connected to the storage solution, and configuring an Elastic Load Balancer attached to the instances.\n\nWhich replacement to the on-premises file share is MOST resilient and durable?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Migrate the file share to Amazon RDS.",
    "B": "Migrate the file share to AWS Storage Gateway.",
    "C": "Migrate the file share to Amazon FSx for Windows File Server.",
    "D": "Migrate the file share to Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS)."
  },
  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": "Amazon FSx for Windows File Server provides fully managed Windows file storage with Multi-AZ deployment for high availability and durability. It's designed for Windows workloads and supports SMB protocol natively. RDS is for databases, not file shares. Storage Gateway isn't as resilient as native AWS storage. EFS uses NFS and doesn't support Windows/IIS natively."
