  "question": "A company is testing an application that runs on an Amazon EC2 Linux instance. A single 500 GB Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) General Purpose SSD (gp2) volume is attached to the EC2 instance.\n\nThe company will deploy the application on multiple EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group. All instances require access to the data that is stored in the EBS volume. The company needs a highly available and resilient solution that does not introduce significant changes to the application's code.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Provision an EC2 instance that uses NFS server software. Attach a single 500 GB gp2 EBS volume to the instance.",
    "B": "Provision an Amazon FSx for Windows File Server file system. Configure the file system as an SMB file store within a single Availability Zone.",
    "C": "Provision an EC2 instance with two 250 GB Provisioned IOPS SSD EBS volumes.",
    "D": "Provision an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file system. Configure the file system to use General Purpose performance mode."
  },
  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": "Amazon EFS provides a fully managed, highly available, and resilient shared file system that multiple EC2 instances can access simultaneously. It supports Linux instances and requires minimal code changes as it uses standard NFS protocols."
