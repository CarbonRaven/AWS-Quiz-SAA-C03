  "question": "A company is using a SQL database to store movie data that is publicly accessible. The database runs on an Amazon RDS Single-AZ DB instance. A script runs queries at random intervals each day to record the number of new movies that have been added to the database. The script must report a final total during business hours.\nThe company's development team notices that the database performance is inadequate for development tasks when the script is running. A solutions architect must recommend a solution to resolve this issue.\nWhich solution will meet this requirement with the LEAST operational overhead?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Modify the DB instance to be a Multi-AZ deployment.",
    "B": "Create a read replica of the database. Configure the script to query only the read replica.",
    "C": "Instruct the development team to manually export the entries in the database at the end of each day.",
    "D": "Use Amazon ElastiCache to cache the common queries that the script runs against the database."
  },
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": "Read replicas offload read queries from the primary database. Running the reporting script against a read replica eliminates performance impact on the primary database used by developers."
}
