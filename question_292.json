  "question": "A company is preparing a new data platform that will ingest real-time streaming data from multiple sources. The company needs to transform the data before writing the data to Amazon S3. The company needs the ability to use SQL to query the transformed data.\n\nWhich solutions will meet these requirements? (Choose two.)",
  "options": {
    "A": "Use Amazon Kinesis Data Streams to stream the data. Use Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics to transform the data. Use Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose to write the data to Amazon S3. Use Amazon Athena to query the transformed data from Amazon S3.",
    "B": "Use Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (Amazon MSK) to stream the data. Use AWS Glue to transform the data and to write the data to Amazon S3. Use Amazon Athena to query the transformed data from Amazon S3.",
    "C": "Use AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) to ingest the data. Use Amazon EMR to transform the data and to write the data to Amazon S3. Use Amazon Athena to query the transformed data from Amazon S3.",
    "D": "Use Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (Amazon MSK) to stream the data. Use Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics to transform the data and to write the data to Amazon S3. Use the Amazon RDS query editor to query the transformed data from Amazon S3.",
    "E": "Use Amazon Kinesis Data Streams to stream the data. Use AWS Glue to transform the data. Use Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose to write the data to Amazon S3. Use the Amazon RDS query editor to query the transformed data from Amazon S3."
  },
  "correct_answer": ["A", "B"],
  "explanation": "Option A uses Kinesis Data Streams for ingestion, Kinesis Data Analytics for transformation, Firehose for S3 delivery, and Athena for SQL queries. Option B uses MSK for streaming, Glue for transformation and S3 delivery, and Athena for queries. Both support SQL querying via Athena. DMS is for database migration, not real-time streaming. RDS query editor cannot query S3 data."
