  "question": "A company needs to retain application log files for a critical application for 10 years. The application team regularly accesses logs from the past month for troubleshooting, but logs older than 1 month are rarely accessed. The application generates more than 10 TB of logs per month.\nWhich storage option meets these requirements MOST cost-effectively?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Store the logs in Amazon S3. Use AWS Backup to move logs more than 1 month old to S3 Glacier Deep Archive.",
    "B": "Store the logs in Amazon S3. Use S3 Lifecycle policies to move logs more than 1 month old to S3 Glacier Deep Archive.",
    "C": "Store the logs in Amazon CloudWatch Logs. Use AWS Backup to move logs more than 1 month old to S3 Glacier Deep Archive.",
    "D": "Store the logs in Amazon CloudWatch Logs. Use Amazon S3 Lifecycle policies to move logs more than 1 month old to S3 Glacier Deep Archive."
  },
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": "S3 is cost-effective for large log volumes (10TB/month). S3 Lifecycle policies automatically transition objects to Glacier Deep Archive after 1 month for lowest long-term storage costs. AWS Backup doesn't directly move S3 objects to Glacier. CloudWatch Logs is more expensive for this volume."
