  "question": "A company hosts an online shopping application that stores all orders in an Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL Single-AZ DB instance. Management wants to eliminate single points of failure and has asked a solutions architect to recommend an approach to minimize database downtime without requiring any changes to the application code.\n\nWhich solution meets these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Convert the existing database instance to a Multi-AZ deployment by modifying the database instance and specifying the Multi-AZ option.",
    "B": "Create a new RDS Multi-AZ deployment. Take a snapshot of the current RDS instance and restore the new Multi-AZ deployment with the snapshot.",
    "C": "Create a read-only replica of the PostgreSQL database in another Availability Zone. Use Amazon Route 53 weighted record sets to distribute requests across the databases.",
    "D": "Place the RDS for PostgreSQL database in an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group with a minimum group size of two. Use Amazon Route 53 weighted record sets to distribute requests across instances."
  },
  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": "Converting an existing Single-AZ RDS instance to Multi-AZ is a simple modification that requires no application code changes. AWS handles the synchronous replication to the standby instance. This provides automatic failover capability and eliminates the single point of failure."
