    "C": "Migrate the web application to Amazon EC2 instances that run in an Auto Scaling group across two Availability Zones behind an Application Load Balancer. Migrate the database to Amazon RDS with Multi-AZ deployment.",
    "D": "Migrate the web application to three Amazon EC2 instances across three Availability Zones behind an Application Load Balancer. Migrate the database to three EC2 instances across three Availability Zones."
  },
