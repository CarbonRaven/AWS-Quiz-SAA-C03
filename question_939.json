  "question": "A company uses an Amazon RDS for MySQL instance. To prepare for end-of-year processing, the company added a read replica to accommodate extra read-only queries from the company's reporting tool. The read replica CPU usage was 60% and the primary instance CPU usage was 60%.\n\nAfter end-of-year activities are complete, the read replica has a constant 25% CPU usage. The primary instance still has a constant 60% CPU usage. The company wants to rightsize the database and still provide enough performance for future growth.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Delete the read replica. Do not make changes to the primary instance.",
    "B": "Resize the read replica to a smaller instance size. Do not make changes to the primary instance.",
    "C": "Resize the read replica to a larger instance size. Resize the primary instance to a smaller instance size.",
    "D": "Delete the read replica. Resize the primary instance to a larger instance."
  },
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": "The read replica at 25% CPU is over-provisioned and can be resized smaller to reduce costs. The primary at 60% is appropriately sized for current workload with room for growth."
}
