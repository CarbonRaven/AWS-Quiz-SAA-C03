  "question": "A company is preparing to store confidential data in Amazon S3. For compliance reasons, the data must be encrypted at rest. Encryption key usage must be logged for auditing purposes. Keys must be rotated every year.\nWhich solution meets these requirements and is the MOST operationally efficient?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Server-side encryption with customer-provided keys (SSE-C)",
    "B": "Server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3)",
    "C": "Server-side encryption with AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS) with manual rotation",
    "D": "Server-side encryption with AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS) with automatic rotation"
  },
  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": "SSE-KMS provides key usage logging in CloudTrail for auditing. Automatic key rotation handles the yearly rotation requirement with no operational overhead. SSE-S3 doesn't log key usage."
}
