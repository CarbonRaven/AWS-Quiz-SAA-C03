  "question": "A rapidly growing ecommerce company is running its workloads in a single AWS Region. A solutions architect must create a disaster recovery (DR) strategy that includes a different AWS Region. The company wants its database to be up to date in the DR Region with the least possible latency. The remaining infrastructure in the DR Region needs to run at reduced capacity and must be able to scale up if necessary.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements with the LOWEST recovery time objective (RTO)?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Use an Amazon Aurora global database with a pilot light deployment.",
    "B": "Use an Amazon Aurora global database with a warm standby deployment.",
    "C": "Use an Amazon RDS Multi-AZ DB instance with a pilot light deployment.",
    "D": "Use an Amazon RDS Multi-AZ DB instance with a warm standby deployment."
  },
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": "Aurora global database provides sub-second replication to DR region with minimal latency. Warm standby runs reduced capacity infrastructure that can scale up quickly, providing the lowest RTO. Pilot light has higher RTO as infrastructure must be started. RDS Multi-AZ is single-region only and doesn't replicate to a different region. Aurora global database is designed for cross-region replication."
