  "question": "A company will migrate 10 PB of data to Amazon S3 in 6 weeks. The current data center has a 500 Mbps uplink to the internet. Other on-premises applications share the uplink. The company can use 80% of the internet bandwidth for this one-time migration task.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Configure AWS DataSync to migrate the data to Amazon S3 and to automatically verify the data.",
    "B": "Use rsync to transfer the data directly to Amazon S3.",
    "C": "Use the AWS CLI and multiple copy processes to send the data directly to Amazon S3.",
    "D": "Order multiple AWS Snowball devices. Copy the data to the devices. Send the devices to AWS to copy the data to Amazon S3."
  },
  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": "With 500 Mbps at 80% utilization (400 Mbps), transferring 10 PB would take approximately 2.3 years over the internet. AWS Snowball Edge devices can transfer up to 80 TB each and are the only practical solution for migrating 10 PB of data within 6 weeks."
