  "question": "A company performs tests on an application that uses an Amazon DynamoDB table. The tests run for 4 hours once a week. The company knows how many read and write operations the application performs to the table each second during the tests. The company does not currently use DynamoDB for any other use case. A solutions architect needs to optimize the costs for the table.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Choose on-demand mode. Update the read and write capacity units appropriately.",
    "B": "Choose provisioned mode. Update the read and write capacity units appropriately.",
    "C": "Purchase DynamoDB reserved capacity for a 1-year term.",
    "D": "Purchase DynamoDB reserved capacity for a 3-year term."
  },
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": "Since the company knows the exact read/write operations needed and tests run for a predictable 4-hour window weekly, provisioned capacity with known capacity units is more cost-effective than on-demand. Reserved capacity is not cost-effective for only 4 hours of weekly usage."
