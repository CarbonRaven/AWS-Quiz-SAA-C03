  "question": "A company is required to use cryptographic keys in its on-premises key manager. The key manager is outside of the AWS Cloud because of regulatory and compliance requirements. The company wants to manage encryption and decryption by using cryptographic keys that are retained outside of the AWS Cloud and that support a variety of external key managers from different vendors.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Use AWS CloudHSM key store backed by a CloudHSM cluster.",
    "B": "Use an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) external key store backed by an external key manager.",
    "C": "Use the default AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) managed key store.",
    "D": "Use a custom key store backed by an AWS CloudHSM cluster."
  },
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": "AWS KMS External Key Store (XKS) allows you to use cryptographic keys stored in external key managers outside AWS. This meets regulatory requirements for keys to remain on-premises while integrating with AWS services through KMS with minimal operational overhead."
