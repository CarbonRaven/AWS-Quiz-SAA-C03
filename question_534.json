  "question": "A company wants to build a logging solution for its multiple AWS accounts. The company currently stores the logs from all accounts in a centralized account. The company has created an Amazon S3 bucket in the centralized account to store the VPC flow logs and AWS CloudTrail logs. All logs must be highly available for 30 days for frequent analysis, retained for an additional 60 days for backup purposes, and deleted 90 days after creation.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Transition objects to the S3 Standard storage class 30 days after creation. Write an expiration action that directs Amazon S3 to delete objects after 90 days.",
    "B": "Transition objects to the S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) storage class 30 days after creation. Move all objects to the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval storage class after 90 days. Write an expiration action that directs Amazon S3 to delete objects after 90 days.",
    "C": "Transition objects to the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval storage class 30 days after creation. Write an expiration action that directs Amazon S3 to delete objects after 90 days.",
    "D": "Transition objects to the S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA) storage class 30 days after creation. Move all objects to the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval storage class after 90 days. Write an expiration action that directs Amazon S3 to delete objects after 90 days."
  },
  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": "Objects need to be highly available for 30 days (S3 Standard), then retained for backup for 60 days (S3 Glacier), then deleted at 90 days. Transitioning to Glacier after 30 days and expiring at 90 days meets all requirements cost-effectively. Option B/D have conflicting 90-day transitions and expirations."
