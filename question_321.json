  "question": "What should a solutions architect do to ensure that all objects uploaded to an Amazon S3 bucket are encrypted?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Update the bucket policy to deny if the PutObject does not have an s3:x-amz-acl header set.",
    "B": "Update the bucket policy to deny if the PutObject does not have an s3:x-amz-acl header set to private.",
    "C": "Update the bucket policy to deny if the PutObject does not have an aws:SecureTransport header set to true.",
    "D": "Update the bucket policy to deny if the PutObject does not have an x-amz-server-side-encryption header set."
  },
  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": "The x-amz-server-side-encryption header specifies server-side encryption for objects. A bucket policy denying PutObject without this header ensures all uploads are encrypted. ACL headers control access, not encryption. SecureTransport enforces HTTPS but doesn't enforce encryption at rest."
