  "question": "A company has applications hosted on Amazon EC2 instances with IPv6 addresses. The applications must initiate communications with other external applications using the internet. However the company's security policy states that any external service cannot initiate a connection to the EC2 instances.\n\nWhat should a solutions architect recommend to resolve this issue?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Create a NAT gateway and make it the destination of the subnet's route table",
    "B": "Create an internet gateway and make it the destination of the subnet's route table",
    "C": "Create a virtual private gateway and make it the destination of the subnet's route table",
    "D": "Create an egress-only internet gateway and make it the destination of the subnet's route table"
  },
  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": "An egress-only internet gateway is specifically designed for IPv6 traffic. It allows outbound communication from instances to the internet but prevents inbound connections from being initiated from the internet. NAT gateway only works with IPv4."
