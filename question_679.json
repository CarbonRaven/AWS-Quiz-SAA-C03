  "question": "A company wants to back up its on-premises virtual machines (VMs) to AWS. The company's backup solution exports on-premises backups to an Amazon S3 bucket as objects. The S3 backups must be retained for 30 days and must be automatically deleted after 30 days.\n\nWhich combination of steps will meet these requirements? (Choose three.)",
  "options": {
    "A": "Create an S3 bucket that has S3 Object Lock enabled.",
    "B": "Create an S3 bucket that has object versioning enabled.",
    "C": "Configure a default retention period of 30 days for the objects.",
    "D": "Configure an S3 Lifecycle policy to protect the objects for 30 days.",
    "E": "Configure an S3 Lifecycle policy to expire the objects after 30 days.",
    "F": "Configure the backup solution to tag the objects with a 30-day retention period"
  },
  "correct_answer": ["A", "C", "E"],
  "explanation": "S3 Object Lock with a 30-day retention period ensures backups cannot be deleted during retention. A Lifecycle policy to expire objects after 30 days handles automatic deletion. Object Lock requires enabling it on the bucket and setting a default retention period."
