  "question": "A global video streaming company uses Amazon CloudFront as a content distribution network (CDN). The company wants to roll out content in a phased manner across multiple countries. The company needs to ensure that viewers who are outside the countries to which the company rolls out content are not able to view the content.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Add geographic restrictions to the content in CloudFront by using an allow list. Set up a custom error message.",
    "B": "Set up a new URL for restricted content. Authorize access by using a signed URL and cookies. Set up a custom error message.",
    "C": "Encrypt the data for the content that the company distributes. Set up a custom error message.",
    "D": "Create a new URL for restricted content. Set up a time-restricted access policy for signed URLs."
  },
  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": "CloudFront geo-restriction using an allow list limits content access to specified countries. Users from other countries receive a custom error message (403 Forbidden). This is the simplest solution for country-based content restrictions."
}
