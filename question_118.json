  "question": "A company is building a web-based application running on Amazon EC2 instances in multiple Availability Zones. The web application will provide access to a repository of text documents totaling about 900 TB in size. The company anticipates that the web application will experience periods of high demand. A solutions architect must ensure that the storage component for the text documents can scale to meet the demand of the application at all times. The company is concerned about the overall cost of the solution.\nWhich storage solution meets these requirements MOST cost-effectively?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS)",
    "B": "Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS)",
    "C": "Amazon OpenSearch Service (Amazon Elasticsearch Service)",
    "D": "Amazon S3"
  },
  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": "S3 is the most cost-effective for 900TB of documents. It scales automatically, has no capacity planning, and costs less than EBS or EFS for large-scale storage. S3 also provides high availability across AZs."
