  "question": "A company is running a photo hosting service in the us-east-1 Region. The service enables users across multiple countries to upload and view photos. Some photos are heavily viewed for months, and others are viewed for less than a week. The application allows uploads of up to 20 MB for each photo. The service uses the photo metadata to determine which photos to display to each user.\n\nWhich solution provides the appropriate user access MOST cost-effectively?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Store the photos in Amazon DynamoDB. Turn on DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) to cache frequently viewed items.",
    "B": "Store the photos in the Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class. Store the photo metadata and its S3 location in DynamoDB.",
    "C": "Store the photos in the Amazon S3 Standard storage class. Set up an S3 Lifecycle policy to move photos older than 30 days to the S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) storage class. Use the object tags to keep track of metadata.",
    "D": "Store the photos in the Amazon S3 Glacier storage class. Set up an S3 Lifecycle policy to move photos older than 30 days to the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class. Store the photo metadata and its S3 location in Amazon OpenSearch Service."
  },
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": "S3 Intelligent-Tiering automatically moves objects between access tiers based on changing access patterns, ideal for photos with unpredictable viewing patterns. DynamoDB for metadata allows efficient querying. This is more cost-effective than fixed lifecycle policies when access patterns vary."
