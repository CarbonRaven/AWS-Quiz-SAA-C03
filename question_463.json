  "question": "An IoT company is releasing a mattress that has sensors to collect data about a user's sleep. The sensors will send data to an Amazon S3 bucket. The sensors collect approximately 2 MB of data every night for each mattress. The company must process and summarize the data for each mattress. The results need to be available as soon as possible. Data processing will require 1 GB of memory and will finish within 30 seconds.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Use AWS Glue with a Scala job",
    "B": "Use Amazon EMR with an Apache Spark script",
    "C": "Use AWS Lambda with a Python script",
    "D": "Use AWS Glue with a PySpark job"
  },
  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": "Lambda is the most cost-effective for small, quick processing jobs. 2 MB data, 1 GB memory requirement, and 30-second processing time are well within Lambda limits. Lambda charges only for execution time. Glue and EMR have higher minimum costs and overhead for such small workloads."
