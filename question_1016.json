  "question": "A company runs an application in a private subnet behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB) in a VPC. The VPC has a NAT gateway and an internet gateway. The application calls the Amazon S3 API to store objects.\n\nAccording to the company's security policy, traffic from the application must not travel across the internet.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Configure an S3 interface endpoint. Create a security group that allows outbound traffic to Amazon S3.",
    "B": "Configure an S3 gateway endpoint. Update the VPC route table to use the endpoint.",
    "C": "Configure an S3 bucket policy to allow traffic from the Elastic IP address that is assigned to the NAT gateway.",
    "D": "Create a second NAT gateway in the same subnet where the legacy application is deployed. Update the VPC route table to use the second NAT gateway."
  },
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": "S3 gateway endpoints are free and keep traffic within the AWS network, not traversing the internet. Gateway endpoints require route table updates. Interface endpoints (option A) work but incur hourly charges and data processing fees. NAT gateway options (C, D) route traffic through the internet, violating the security requirement."
