  "question": "A company uses AWS Organizations. The company wants to operate some of its AWS accounts with different budgets. The company wants to receive alerts and automatically prevent provisioning of additional resources on AWS accounts when the allocated budget threshold is met during a specific period.\n\nWhich combination of solutions will meet these requirements? (Choose three.)",
  "options": {
    "A": "Use AWS Budgets to create a budget. Set the budget amount under the Cost and Usage Reports section of the required AWS accounts.",
    "B": "Use AWS Budgets to create a budget. Set the budget amount under the Billing dashboards of the required AWS accounts.",
    "C": "Create an IAM user for AWS Budgets to run budget actions with the required permissions.",
    "D": "Create an IAM role for AWS Budgets to run budget actions with the required permissions.",
    "E": "Add an alert to notify the company when each account meets its budget threshold. Add a budget action that selects the IAM identity created with the appropriate config rule to prevent provisioning of additional resources.",
    "F": "Add an alert to notify the company when each account meets its budget threshold. Add a budget action that selects the IAM identity created with the appropriate service control policy (SCP) to prevent provisioning of additional resources."
  },
  "correct_answer": ["B", "D", "F"],
  "explanation": "AWS Budgets is configured in the Billing dashboard (B). An IAM role (not user) should be created for AWS Budgets to run budget actions (D). Budget actions can apply SCPs to prevent resource provisioning when thresholds are met (F). SCPs are the appropriate mechanism to restrict actions across accounts in Organizations."
