  "question": "A company recently announced the deployment of its retail website to a global audience. The website runs on multiple Amazon EC2 instances behind an Elastic Load Balancer. The instances run in an Auto Scaling group across multiple Availability Zones.\n\nThe company wants to provide its customers with different versions of content based on the devices that the customers use to access the website.\n\nWhich combination of actions should a solutions architect take to meet these requirements? (Choose two.)",
  "options": {
    "A": "Configure Amazon CloudFront to cache multiple versions of the content.",
    "B": "Configure a host header in a Network Load Balancer to forward traffic to different instances.",
    "C": "Configure a Lambda@Edge function to send specific objects to users based on the User-Agent header.",
    "D": "Configure AWS Global Accelerator. Forward requests to a Network Load Balancer (NLB). Configure the NLB to set up host-based routing to different EC2 instances.",
    "E": "Configure AWS Global Accelerator. Forward requests to a Network Load Balancer (NLB). Configure the NLB to set up path-based routing to different EC2 instances."
  },
  "correct_answer": ["A", "C"],
  "explanation": "CloudFront (A) can cache multiple versions of content for different devices. Lambda@Edge (C) can inspect the User-Agent header and serve device-specific content. NLBs don't support host-based or path-based routing - those are ALB features. Global Accelerator improves latency but doesn't handle device-based content variation."
