  "question": "A company migrated millions of archival files to Amazon S3. A solutions architect needs to implement a solution that will encrypt all the archival data by using a customer-provided key. The solution must encrypt existing unencrypted objects and future objects.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Create a list of unencrypted objects by filtering an Amazon S3 Inventory report. Configure an S3 Batch Operations job to encrypt the objects from the list with a server-side encryption with a customer-provided key (SSE-C). Configure the S3 default encryption feature to use a server-side encryption with a customer-provided key (SSE-C).",
    "B": "Use S3 Storage Lens metrics to identify unencrypted S3 buckets. Configure the S3 default encryption feature to use a server-side encryption with AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS).",
    "C": "Create a list of unencrypted objects by filtering the AWS usage report for Amazon S3. Configure an AWS Batch job to encrypt the objects from the list with a server-side encryption with AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS). Configure the S3 default encryption feature to use a server-side encryption with AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS).",
    "D": "Create a list of unencrypted objects by filtering the AWS usage report for Amazon S3. Configure the S3 default encryption feature to use a server-side encryption with a customer-provided key (SSE-C)."
  },
  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": "S3 Inventory can identify unencrypted objects. S3 Batch Operations can encrypt existing objects using SSE-C (customer-provided keys). Configuring S3 default encryption ensures future objects are encrypted. This addresses both existing and future objects with customer-provided keys."
