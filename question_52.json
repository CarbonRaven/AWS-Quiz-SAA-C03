  "question": "A company wants to migrate its on-premises application to AWS. The application produces output files that vary in size from tens of gigabytes to hundreds of terabytes. The application data must be stored in a standard file system structure. The company wants a solution that scales automatically, is highly available, and requires minimum operational overhead.\nWhich solution will meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Migrate the application to run as containers on Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS). Use Amazon S3 for storage.",
    "B": "Migrate the application to run as containers on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS). Use Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) for storage.",
    "C": "Migrate the application to Amazon EC2 instances in a Multi-AZ Auto Scaling group. Use Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) for storage.",
    "D": "Migrate the application to Amazon EC2 instances in a Multi-AZ Auto Scaling group. Use Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) for storage."
  },
  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": "EFS provides a standard file system structure, scales automatically to petabytes, is highly available across AZs, and requires minimal operational overhead. EBS doesn't provide shared storage across instances."
}
