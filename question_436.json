  "question": "A company moved its on-premises PostgreSQL database to an Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance. The company successfully launched a new product. The workload on the database has increased. The company wants to accommodate the larger workload without adding infrastructure.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Buy reserved DB instances for the total workload. Make the Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance larger.",
    "B": "Make the Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance a Multi-AZ DB instance.",
    "C": "Buy reserved DB instances for the total workload. Add another Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance.",
    "D": "Make the Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance an on-demand DB instance."
  },
  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": "Vertical scaling (larger instance) handles increased workload without adding infrastructure. Reserved Instances provide cost savings for consistent workloads. Multi-AZ provides HA but not performance improvement. Adding another instance adds infrastructure. On-Demand is more expensive than Reserved for sustained usage."
}
