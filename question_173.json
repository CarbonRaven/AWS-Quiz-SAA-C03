  "question": "A gaming company hosts a browser-based application on AWS. The users of the application consume a large number of videos and images that are stored in Amazon S3. This content is the same for all users.\nThe application has increased in popularity, and millions of users worldwide are accessing these media files. The company wants to provide the files to the users while reducing the load on the origin.\nWhich solution meets these requirements MOST cost-effectively?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Deploy an AWS Global Accelerator accelerator in front of the web servers.",
    "B": "Deploy an Amazon CloudFront web distribution in front of the S3 bucket.",
    "C": "Deploy an Amazon ElastiCache for Redis instance in front of the web servers.",
    "D": "Deploy an Amazon ElastiCache for Memcached instance in front of the web servers."
  },
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": "CloudFront caches static content (videos and images) at edge locations globally, reducing load on the S3 origin and providing low-latency access worldwide. This is the most cost-effective solution for static content delivery. ElastiCache is for application data caching, not media delivery."
