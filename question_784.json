  "question": "A company's marketing data is uploaded from multiple sources to an Amazon S3 bucket. A series of data preparation jobs aggregate the data for reporting. The data preparation jobs need to run at regular intervals in parallel. A few jobs need to run in a specific order later.\n\nThe company wants to remove the operational overhead of job error handling, retry logic, and state management.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Use an AWS Lambda function to process the data as soon as the data is uploaded to the S3 bucket. Invoke other Lambda functions at regularly scheduled intervals.",
    "B": "Use Amazon Athena to process the data. Use Amazon EventBridge Scheduler to invoke Athena on a regular interval.",
    "C": "Use AWS Glue DataBrew to process the data. Use an AWS Step Functions state machine to run the DataBrew data preparation jobs.",
    "D": "Use AWS Data Pipeline to process the data. Schedule Data Pipeline to process the data once at midnight."
  },
  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": "AWS Glue DataBrew provides visual data preparation without coding. AWS Step Functions provides built-in error handling, retry logic, and state management for orchestrating jobs. Step Functions can run jobs in parallel and in sequence as needed, meeting all requirements with minimal operational overhead."
