  "question": "A company is migrating five on-premises applications to VPCs in the AWS Cloud. Each application is currently deployed in isolated virtual networks on premises and should be deployed similarly in the AWS Cloud. The applications need to reach a shared services VPC. All the applications must be able to communicate with each other.\n\nIf the migration is successful, the company will repeat the migration process for more than 100 applications.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST administrative overhead?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Deploy software VPN tunnels between the application VPCs and the shared services VPC. Add routes between the application VPCs in their subnets to the shared services VPC.",
    "B": "Deploy VPC peering connections between the application VPCs and the shared services VPC. Add routes between the application VPCs in their subnets to the shared services VPC through the peering connection.",
    "C": "Deploy an AWS Direct Connect connection between the application VPCs and the shared services VPC. Add routes from the application VPCs in their subnets to the shared services VPC and the applications VPCs. Add routes from the shared services VPC subnets to the applications VPCs.",
    "D": "Deploy a transit gateway with associations between the transit gateway and the application VPCs and the shared services VPC. Add routes between the application VPCs in their subnets and the application VPCs to the shared services VPC through the transit gateway."
  },
  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": "Transit Gateway provides a hub-and-spoke model that scales efficiently for 100+ VPCs with the least administrative overhead. VPC peering requires n*(n-1)/2 connections and doesn't scale well. Transit Gateway simplifies routing between all VPCs."
