  "question": "An application runs on Amazon EC2 instances in private subnets. The application needs to access an Amazon DynamoDB table.\nWhat is the MOST secure way to access the table while ensuring that the traffic does not leave the AWS network?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Use a VPC endpoint for DynamoDB.",
    "B": "Use a NAT gateway in a public subnet.",
    "C": "Use a NAT instance in a private subnet.",
    "D": "Use the internet gateway attached to the VPC."
  },
  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": "A VPC gateway endpoint for DynamoDB keeps traffic entirely within the AWS network without requiring internet access. NAT gateways and internet gateways route traffic over the public internet, which is less secure. VPC endpoints are the most secure option for AWS service access."
}
