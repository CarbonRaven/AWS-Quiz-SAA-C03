  "question": "A company is implementing a shared storage solution for a media application that is hosted in the AWS Cloud. The company needs the ability to use SMB clients to access data. The solution must be fully managed.\nWhich AWS solution meets these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Create an AWS Storage Gateway volume gateway. Create a file share that uses the required client protocol. Connect the application server to the file share.",
    "B": "Create an AWS Storage Gateway tape gateway. Configure tapes to use Amazon S3. Connect the application server to the tape gateway.",
    "C": "Create an Amazon EC2 Windows instance. Install and configure a Windows file share role on the instance. Connect the application server to the file share.",
    "D": "Create an Amazon FSx for Windows File Server file system. Attach the file system to the origin server. Connect the application server to the file system."
  },
  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": "Amazon FSx for Windows File Server is fully managed and provides native SMB protocol support. It's designed for Windows-based applications requiring shared file storage. EC2 Windows instance is not fully managed. Volume and tape gateways don't provide direct SMB file sharing."
