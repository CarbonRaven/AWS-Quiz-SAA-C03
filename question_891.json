  "question": "A company runs its critical storage application in the AWS Cloud. The application uses Amazon S3 in two AWS Regions. The company wants the application to send remote user data to the nearest S3 bucket with no public network congestion. The company also wants the application to fail over with the least amount of management of Amazon S3.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Implement an active-active design between the two Regions. Configure the application to use the regional S3 endpoints closest to the user.",
    "B": "Use an active-passive configuration with S3 Multi-Region Access Points. Create a global endpoint for each of the Regions.",
    "C": "Send user data to the regional S3 endpoints closest to the user. Configure an S3 cross-account replication rule to keep the S3 buckets synchronized.",
    "D": "Set up Amazon S3 to use Multi-Region Access Points in an active-active configuration with a single global endpoint. Configure S3 Cross-Region Replication."
  },
  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": "S3 Multi-Region Access Points with a single global endpoint automatically routes requests to the nearest S3 bucket, handles failover automatically, and uses AWS Global Accelerator to avoid public network congestion. Cross-Region Replication keeps data synchronized."
}
