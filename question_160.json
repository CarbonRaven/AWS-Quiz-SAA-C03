  "question": "An ecommerce company hosts its analytics application in the AWS Cloud. The application generates about 300 MB of data each month. The data is stored in JSON format. The company is evaluating a disaster recovery solution to back up the data. The data must be accessible in milliseconds if it is needed, and the data must be kept for 30 days.\nWhich solution meets these requirements MOST cost-effectively?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Amazon OpenSearch Service (Amazon Elasticsearch Service)",
    "B": "Amazon S3 Glacier",
    "C": "Amazon S3 Standard",
    "D": "Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL"
  },
  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": "S3 Standard provides millisecond access latency and is highly cost-effective for 300 MB/month of data. Glacier has retrieval delays (minutes to hours). OpenSearch and RDS are overkill for simple backup storage of small JSON files."
