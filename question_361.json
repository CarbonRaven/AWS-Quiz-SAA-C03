  "question": "A company is storing data on premises on a Windows file server. The company produces 5 GB of new data daily. The company migrated part of its Windows-based workload to AWS and needs the data to be available on a file system in the cloud. The company already has established an AWS Direct Connect connection between the on-premises network and AWS.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Use the file gateway configuration of AWS Storage Gateway. Create an SMB file share. Access the file share from the cloud workload by using the DNS name.",
    "B": "Use AWS DataSync to schedule a daily task to replicate data between the on-premises Windows file server and Amazon FSx.",
    "C": "Use AWS Data Pipeline to schedule a daily task to replicate data between the on-premises Windows file server and Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS).",
    "D": "Use AWS DataSync to schedule a daily task to replicate data between the on-premises Windows file server and Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS)."
  },
  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": "Storage Gateway file gateway with SMB file share provides real-time access to files stored in S3 from on-premises Windows workloads. The DNS name allows cloud workloads to access the same data with minimal operational overhead. DataSync requires scheduled tasks. EFS doesn't support SMB protocol for Windows workloads."
