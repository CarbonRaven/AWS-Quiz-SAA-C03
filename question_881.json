  "question": "A company is hosting a high-traffic static website on Amazon S3 with an Amazon CloudFront distribution that has a default TTL of 0 seconds. The company wants to implement caching to improve performance for the website. However, the company also wants to ensure that stale content is not served for more than a few minutes after a deployment.\n\nWhich combination of caching methods should a solutions architect implement to meet these requirements? (Choose two.)",
  "options": {
    "A": "Set the CloudFront default TTL to 2 minutes.",
    "B": "Set a default TTL of 2 minutes on the S3 bucket.",
    "C": "Add a Cache-Control private directive to the objects in Amazon S3.",
    "D": "Create an AWS Lambda@Edge function to add an Expires header to HTTP responses. Configure the function to run on viewer response.",
    "E": "Add a Cache-Control max-age directive of 24 hours to the objects in Amazon S3. On deployment, create a CloudFront invalidation to clear any changed files from edge caches."
  },
  "correct_answer": ["A", "E"],
  "explanation": "Setting a CloudFront default TTL of 2 minutes ensures a fallback if objects don't have Cache-Control headers. Using max-age of 24 hours with invalidation on deployment provides optimal caching while preventing stale content after deployments."
}
