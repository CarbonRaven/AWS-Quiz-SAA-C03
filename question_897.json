  "question": "A company runs a critical data analysis job each week before the first day of the work week. The job requires at least 1 hour to complete the analysis. The job is stateful and cannot tolerate interruptions. The company needs a solution to run the job on AWS.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Create a container for the job. Schedule the job to run as an AWS Fargate task on an Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) cluster by using Amazon EventBridge Scheduler.",
    "B": "Configure the job to run in an AWS Lambda function. Create a scheduled rule in Amazon EventBridge to invoke the Lambda function.",
    "C": "Configure an Auto Scaling group of Amazon EC2 Spot Instances that run Amazon Linux. Configure a crontab entry on the instances to run the analysis.",
    "D": "Configure an AWS DataSync task to run the job. Configure a cron expression to run the task on a schedule."
  },
  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": "Fargate with ECS provides a containerized, managed solution that can run for over an hour without interruption. Lambda has a 15-minute timeout, Spot Instances can be interrupted, and DataSync is for data transfer, not job processing."
