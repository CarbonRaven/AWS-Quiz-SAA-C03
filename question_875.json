  "question": "A company runs an application on Amazon EC2 instances in a private subnet. The application needs to store and retrieve data in Amazon S3 buckets. According to regulatory requirements, the data must not travel across the public internet.\n\nWhat should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Deploy a NAT gateway to access the S3 buckets.",
    "B": "Deploy AWS Storage Gateway to access the S3 buckets.",
    "C": "Deploy an S3 interface endpoint to access the S3 buckets.",
    "D": "Deploy an S3 gateway endpoint to access the S3 buckets."
  },
  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": "S3 gateway endpoints are free and keep traffic within the AWS network, not traversing the public internet. Interface endpoints have hourly charges, and NAT gateways have per-GB data processing costs."
}
