  "question": "A company has created a multi-tier application for its ecommerce website. The website uses an Application Load Balancer that resides in the public subnets, a web tier in the public subnets, and a MySQL cluster hosted on Amazon EC2 instances in the private subnets. The MySQL database needs to retrieve product catalog and pricing information that is hosted on the internet by a third-party provider. A solutions architect must devise a strategy that maximizes security without increasing operational overhead.\n\nWhat should the solutions architect do to meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Deploy a NAT instance in the VPC. Route all the internet-based traffic through the NAT instance.",
    "B": "Deploy a NAT gateway in the public subnets. Modify the private subnet route table to direct all internet-bound traffic to the NAT gateway.",
    "C": "Configure an internet gateway and attach it to the VPC. Modify the private subnet route table to direct internet-bound traffic to the internet gateway.",
    "D": "Configure a virtual private gateway and attach it to the VPC. Modify the private subnet route table to direct internet-bound traffic to the virtual private gateway."
  },
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": "NAT gateway in public subnets allows private subnet resources to access the internet for outbound connections while preventing inbound internet access. It's a managed service with low operational overhead. NAT instances require more management. Internet gateway would expose private instances. Virtual private gateway is for VPN connections."
