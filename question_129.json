  "question": "A company is running a multi-tier web application on premises. The web application is containerized and runs on a number of Linux hosts connected to a PostgreSQL database that contains user records. The operational overhead of maintaining the infrastructure and capacity planning is limiting the company's growth. A solutions architect must improve the application's infrastructure.\nWhich combination of actions should the solutions architect take to accomplish this? (Choose two.)",
  "options": {
    "A": "Migrate the PostgreSQL database to Amazon Aurora.",
    "B": "Migrate the web application to be hosted on Amazon EC2 instances.",
    "C": "Set up an Amazon CloudFront distribution for the web application content.",
    "D": "Set up Amazon ElastiCache between the web application and the PostgreSQL database.",
    "E": "Migrate the web application to be hosted on AWS Fargate with Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS)."
  },
  "correct_answer": ["A", "E"],
  "explanation": "Aurora reduces database operational overhead with automated backups, patching, and scaling. Fargate with ECS eliminates server management for containers - no capacity planning needed. Both services are fully managed, reducing operational burden significantly."
