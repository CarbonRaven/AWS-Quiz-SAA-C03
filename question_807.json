  "question": "A company uses high concurrency AWS Lambda functions to process a constantly increasing number of messages in a message queue during marketing events. The Lambda functions use CPU intensive code to process the messages. The company wants to reduce the compute costs and to maintain service latency for its customers.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Configure reserved concurrency for the Lambda functions. Decrease the memory allocated to the Lambda functions.",
    "B": "Configure reserved concurrency for the Lambda functions. Increase the memory according to AWS Compute Optimizer recommendations.",
    "C": "Configure provisioned concurrency for the Lambda functions. Decrease the memory allocated to the Lambda functions.",
    "D": "Configure provisioned concurrency for the Lambda functions. Increase the memory according to AWS Compute Optimizer recommendations."
  },
  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": "Provisioned concurrency eliminates cold starts to maintain service latency. Increasing memory based on Compute Optimizer recommendations for CPU-intensive workloads improves performance and can reduce costs by completing executions faster."
}
