  "question": "A company is designing a containerized application that will use Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS). The application needs to access a shared file system that is highly durable and can recover data to another AWS Region with a recovery point objective (RPO) of 8 hours. The file system needs to provide a mount target in each Availability Zone within a Region.\n\nA solutions architect wants to use AWS Backup to manage the replication to another Region.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Amazon FSx for Windows File Server with a Multi-AZ deployment",
    "B": "Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP with a Multi-AZ deployment",
    "C": "Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) with the Standard storage class",
    "D": "Amazon FSx for OpenZFS"
  },
  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": "Amazon EFS with Standard storage class provides mount targets in each AZ, high durability, and is fully supported by AWS Backup for cross-Region replication. EFS is well-suited for containerized applications on ECS and meets the 8-hour RPO requirement with AWS Backup."
