  "question": "A company has migrated a fleet of hundreds of on-premises virtual machines (VMs) to Amazon EC2 instances. The instances run a diverse fleet of Windows Server versions along with several Linux distributions. The company wants a solution that will automate inventory and updates of the operating systems. The company also needs a summary of common vulnerabilities of each instance for regular monthly reviews.\n\nWhat should a solutions architect recommend to meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to manage all the EC2 instances. Configure AWS Security Hub to produce monthly reports.",
    "B": "Set up AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to manage all the EC2 instances. Deploy Amazon Inspector, and configure monthly reports.",
    "C": "Set up AWS Shield Advanced, and configure monthly reports. Deploy AWS Config to automate patch installations on the EC2 instances.",
    "D": "Set up Amazon GuardDuty in the account to monitor all EC2 instances. Deploy AWS Config to automate patch installations on the EC2 instances."
  },
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": "Systems Manager Patch Manager handles OS patching and inventory. Amazon Inspector provides vulnerability assessments with findings that can be used for monthly vulnerability reports. Security Hub aggregates findings but Inspector is better for CVE scanning."
}
