  "question": "A company is relocating its data center and wants to securely transfer 50 TB of data to AWS within 2 weeks. The existing data center has a Site-to-Site VPN connection to AWS that is 90% utilized.\n\nWhich AWS service should a solutions architect use to meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "AWS DataSync with a VPC endpoint",
    "B": "AWS Direct Connect",
    "C": "AWS Snowball Edge Storage Optimized",
    "D": "AWS Storage Gateway"
  },
  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": "With the VPN already 90% utilized, there's insufficient bandwidth for online transfer. Snowball Edge Storage Optimized can transfer 50 TB within 2 weeks through physical device shipment. Direct Connect takes weeks to provision, and DataSync/Storage Gateway would require network bandwidth."
