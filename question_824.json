The company needs a highly available and automatically scalable solution to handle increased traffic.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Deploy the application to EC2 instances that run in an Auto Scaling group behind an Application Load Balancer. Create an Amazon Redshift cluster that has multiple MySQL-compatible nodes.",
    "B": "Deploy the application to EC2 instances that are configured as a target group behind an Application Load Balancer. Create an Amazon RDS for MySQL cluster that has multiple instances.",
    "C": "Deploy the application to EC2 instances that run in an Auto Scaling group behind an Application Load Balancer. Create an Amazon Aurora Serverless MySQL cluster for the database layer.",
    "D": "Deploy the application to EC2 instances that are configured as a target group behind an Application Load Balancer. Create an Amazon ElastiCache for Redis cluster that uses the MySQL connector."
  },
  "correct_answer": "C",
