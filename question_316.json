  "question": "A company uses an Amazon EC2 instance to run a script to poll for and process messages in an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. The company wants to reduce operational costs while maintaining its ability to process a growing number of messages that are added to the queue.\n\nWhat should a solutions architect recommend to meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Increase the size of the EC2 instance to process messages faster.",
    "B": "Use Amazon EventBridge to turn off the EC2 instance when the instance is underutilized.",
    "C": "Migrate the script on the EC2 instance to an AWS Lambda function with the appropriate runtime.",
    "D": "Use AWS Systems Manager Run Command to run the script on demand."
  },
  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": "Lambda is serverless and scales automatically with SQS message volume. You only pay for execution time, reducing costs compared to always-running EC2. Lambda can be triggered directly by SQS. Larger EC2 increases costs. EventBridge control adds complexity. Run Command doesn't provide automatic scaling."
