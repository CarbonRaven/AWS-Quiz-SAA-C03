  "question": "A company is deploying an application in three AWS Regions using an Application Load Balancer. Amazon Route 53 will be used to distribute traffic between these Regions.\n\nWhich Route 53 configuration should a solutions architect use to provide the MOST high-performing experience?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Create an A record with a latency policy.",
    "B": "Create an A record with a geolocation policy.",
    "C": "Create a CNAME record with a failover policy.",
    "D": "Create a CNAME record with a geoproximity policy."
  },
  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": "Latency-based routing directs users to the Region with the lowest network latency, providing the best performance. A records are used for ALB endpoints (alias records). Geolocation routes based on user location, not performance. CNAME cannot be used at zone apex."
}
