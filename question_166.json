  "question": "Organizers for a global event want to put daily reports online as static HTML pages. The pages are expected to generate millions of views from users around the world. The files are stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. A solutions architect has been asked to design an efficient and effective solution.\nWhich action should the solutions architect take to accomplish this?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Generate presigned URLs for the files.",
    "B": "Use cross-Region replication to all Regions.",
    "C": "Use the geoproximity feature of Amazon Route 53.",
    "D": "Use Amazon CloudFront with the S3 bucket as its origin."
  },
  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": "CloudFront caches static content at edge locations globally, providing low-latency access for millions of users worldwide. It reduces load on the S3 origin and scales automatically. Cross-region replication adds complexity without the caching benefits of a CDN."
}
