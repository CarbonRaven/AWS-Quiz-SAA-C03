  "question": "A company has a web application with sporadic usage patterns. There is heavy usage at the beginning of each month, moderate usage at the start of each week, and unpredictable usage during the week. The application consists of a web server and a MySQL database server running inside the data center. The company would like to move the application to the AWS Cloud, and needs to select a cost-effective database platform that will not require database modifications.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Amazon DynamoDB",
    "B": "Amazon RDS for MySQL",
    "C": "MySQL-compatible Amazon Aurora Serverless",
    "D": "MySQL deployed on Amazon EC2 in an Auto Scaling group"
  },
  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": "Aurora Serverless automatically scales capacity based on demand and only charges for resources used, making it cost-effective for sporadic workloads. It's MySQL-compatible so no database modifications are needed. DynamoDB requires application changes (NoSQL). Standard RDS doesn't scale down during low usage. EC2 with Auto Scaling requires management overhead."
