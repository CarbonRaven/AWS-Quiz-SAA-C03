  "question": "A company wants to provide data scientists with near real-time read-only access to the company's production Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL database. The database is currently configured as a Single-AZ database. The data scientists use complex queries that will not affect the production database. The company needs a solution that is highly available.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Scale the existing production database in a maintenance window to provide enough power for the data scientists.",
    "B": "Change the setup from a Single-AZ to a Multi-AZ instance deployment with a larger secondary standby instance. Provide the data scientists access to the secondary instance.",
    "C": "Change the setup from a Single-AZ to a Multi-AZ instance deployment. Provide two additional read replicas for the data scientists.",
    "D": "Change the setup from a Single-AZ to a Multi-AZ cluster deployment with two readable standby instances. Provide read endpoints to the data scientists."
  },
  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": "Multi-AZ cluster deployment provides two readable standby instances, offering both high availability and read scaling for data scientists. This is more cost-effective than creating separate read replicas. Standard Multi-AZ standby instances are not readable."
}
