  "question": "A company is running a publicly accessible serverless application that uses Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda. The application's traffic recently spiked due to fraudulent requests from botnets.\nWhich steps should a solutions architect take to block requests from unauthorized users? (Choose two.)",
  "options": {
    "A": "Create a usage plan with an API key that is shared with genuine users only.",
    "B": "Integrate logic within the Lambda function to ignore the requests from fraudulent IP addresses.",
    "C": "Implement an AWS WAF rule to target malicious requests and trigger actions to filter them out.",
    "D": "Convert the existing public API to a private API. Update the DNS records to redirect users to the new API endpoint.",
    "E": "Create an IAM role for each user attempting to access the API. A user will assume the role when making the API call."
  },
  "correct_answer": ["A", "C"],
  "explanation": "AWS WAF protects against web exploits and can block malicious requests based on IP, rate limiting, and patterns. API keys with usage plans restrict access to authorized users only. These are the most effective and manageable approaches for a serverless public API."
