  "question": "A company runs a global web application on Amazon EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer. The application stores data in Amazon Aurora. The company needs to create a disaster recovery solution and can tolerate up to 30 minutes of downtime and potential data loss. The solution does not need to handle the load when the primary infrastructure is healthy.\nWhich solution will meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Deploy the application with the required infrastructure elements in place. Use Amazon Route 53 to configure active-passive failover. Create an Aurora Replica in a second AWS Region.",
    "B": "Host a scaled-down deployment of the application in a second AWS Region. Use Amazon Route 53 to configure active-active failover. Create an Aurora Replica in the second Region.",
    "C": "Replicate the primary infrastructure in a second AWS Region. Use Amazon Route 53 to configure active-active failover. Create an Aurora database that is restored from the latest snapshot.",
    "D": "Back up data with AWS Backup. Use the backup to create the required infrastructure in a second AWS Region. Use Amazon Route 53 to configure active-passive failover. Create an Aurora second primary instance in the second Region."
  },
  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": "Active-passive failover with Route 53 meets the requirement that DR doesn't handle load when primary is healthy. Aurora cross-region replica provides data replication with minimal lag, meeting the 30-minute RPO/RTO tolerance. Infrastructure can be pre-deployed but idle."
