  "question": "A company's website is used to sell products to the public. The site runs on Amazon EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB). There is also an Amazon CloudFront distribution, and AWS WAF is being used to protect against SQL injection attacks. The ALB is the origin for the CloudFront distribution. A recent review of security logs revealed an external malicious IP that needs to be blocked from accessing the website.\n\nWhat should a solutions architect do to protect the application?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Modify the network ACL on the CloudFront distribution to add a deny rule for the malicious IP address.",
    "B": "Modify the configuration of AWS WAF to add an IP match condition to block the malicious IP address.",
    "C": "Modify the network ACL for the EC2 instances in the target groups behind the ALB to deny the malicious IP address.",
    "D": "Modify the security groups for the EC2 instances in the target groups behind the ALB to deny the malicious IP address."
  },
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": "AWS WAF IP match conditions can block specific IP addresses or IP ranges. Since WAF is already in use with CloudFront, adding an IP match rule is the appropriate solution. Network ACLs and security groups would see CloudFront IPs, not the original client IP."
}
