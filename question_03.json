The company wants to limit access to this S3 bucket to only users of accounts within the organization in AWS Organizations.\nWhich solution meets these requirements with the LEAST amount of operational overhead?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Add the aws:PrincipalOrgID global condition key with a reference to the organization ID to the S3 bucket policy.",

    "C": "Use AWS CloudTrail to monitor the CreateAccount, InviteAccountToOrganization, LeaveOrganization, and RemoveAccountFromOrganization events. Update the S3 bucket policy accordingly.",
    "D": "Tag each user that needs access to the S3 bucket. Add the aws:PrincipalTag global condition key to the S3 bucket policy."
  },
  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": "The aws:PrincipalOrgID condition key allows you to restrict access to only principals from accounts within a specific AWS Organization. This is the simplest approach with least operational overhead."
