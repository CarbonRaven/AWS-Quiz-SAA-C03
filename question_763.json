  "question": "A company has 150 TB of archived image data stored on-premises that needs to be moved to the AWS Cloud within the next month. The company's current network connection allows up to 100 Mbps uploads for this purpose during the night only.\n\nWhat is the MOST cost-effective mechanism to move this data and meet the migration deadline?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Use AWS Snowmobile to ship the data to AWS.",
    "B": "Order multiple AWS Snowball devices to ship the data to AWS.",
    "C": "Enable Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration and securely upload the data.",
    "D": "Create an Amazon S3 VPC endpoint and establish a VPN to upload the data."
  },
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": "At 100 Mbps for only nighttime hours, network transfer would take too long for 150 TB. AWS Snowball Edge devices (80 TB each) can handle this volume efficiently. Multiple Snowball devices can be ordered and shipped in parallel. Snowmobile is designed for exabyte-scale migrations (10+ PB), making it overkill for 150 TB."
