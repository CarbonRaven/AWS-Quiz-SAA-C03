  "question": "A company has deployed a database in Amazon RDS for MySQL. Due to increased transactions, the database support team is reporting slow reads against the DB instance and recommends adding a read replica.\nWhich combination of actions should a solutions architect take before implementing this change? (Choose two.)",
  "options": {
    "A": "Enable binlog replication on the RDS primary node.",
    "B": "Choose a failover priority for the source DB instance.",
    "C": "Allow long-running transactions to complete on the source DB instance.",
    "D": "Create a global table and specify the AWS Regions where the table will be available.",
    "E": "Enable automatic backups on the source instance by setting the backup retention period to a value other than 0."
  },
  "correct_answer": ["C", "E"],
  "explanation": "Automatic backups must be enabled (backup retention > 0) before creating read replicas - this is a prerequisite (E). Long-running transactions should complete to avoid replication lag and ensure consistent replica creation (C). Binlog is automatic for RDS. Global tables are DynamoDB feature."
