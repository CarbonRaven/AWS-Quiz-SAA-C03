  "question": "A company is planning to migrate a legacy application to AWS. The application currently uses NFS to communicate to an on-premises storage solution to store application data. The application cannot be modified to use any other communication protocols other than NFS for this purpose.\n\nWhich storage solution should a solutions architect recommend for use after the migration?",
  "options": {
    "A": "AWS DataSync",

    "C": "Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS)",
    "D": "Amazon EMR File System (Amazon EMRFS)"
  },
  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": "Amazon EFS provides a fully managed NFS file system that is compatible with NFS protocols. It can be mounted by EC2 instances using standard NFS commands, making it the ideal choice for applications that require NFS communication."
