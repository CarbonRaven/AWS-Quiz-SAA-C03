  "question": "A solutions architect configured a VPC that has a small range of IP addresses. The number of Amazon EC2 instances that are in the VPC is increasing, and there is an insufficient number of IP addresses for future workloads.\n\nWhich solution resolves this issue with the LEAST operational overhead?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Add an additional IPv4 CIDR block to increase the number of IP addresses and create additional subnets in the VPC. Create new resources in the new subnets by using the new CIDR.",
    "B": "Create a second VPC with additional subnets. Use a peering connection to connect the second VPC with the first VPC. Update the routes and create new resources in the subnets of the second VPC.",
    "C": "Use AWS Transit Gateway to add a transit gateway and connect a second VPC with the first VPC. Update the routes of the transit gateway and VPCs. Create new resources in the subnets of the second VPC.",
    "D": "Create a second VPC. Create a Site-to-Site VPN connection between the first VPC and the second VPC by using a VPN-hosted solution on Amazon EC2 and a virtual private gateway. Update the route between VPCs to the traffic through the VPN. Create new resources in the subnets of the second VPC."
  },
  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": "Adding a secondary CIDR block to an existing VPC is the simplest solution with least overhead. AWS allows adding additional CIDR ranges to a VPC. VPC peering and Transit Gateway require managing multiple VPCs. Site-to-Site VPN adds complexity and latency. Secondary CIDRs maintain a single VPC architecture."
