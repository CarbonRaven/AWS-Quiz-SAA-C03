  "question": "A company wants to improve its ability to clone large amounts of production data into a test environment in the same AWS Region. The data is stored in Amazon EC2 instances on Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes. Modifications to the cloned data must not affect the production environment. The software that accesses this data requires consistently high I/O performance.\nA solutions architect needs to minimize the time that is required to clone the production data into the test environment.\nWhich solution will meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Take EBS snapshots of the production EBS volumes. Restore the snapshots onto EC2 instance store volumes in the test environment.",
    "B": "Configure the production EBS volumes to use the EBS Multi-Attach feature. Take EBS snapshots of the production EBS volumes. Attach the production EBS volumes to the EC2 instances in the test environment.",
    "C": "Take EBS snapshots of the production EBS volumes. Create and initialize new EBS volumes. Attach the new EBS volumes to EC2 instances in the test environment before restoring the volumes from the production EBS snapshots.",
    "D": "Take EBS snapshots of the production EBS volumes. Turn on the EBS fast snapshot restore feature on the EBS snapshots. Restore the snapshots into new EBS volumes. Attach the new EBS volumes to EC2 instances in the test environment."
  },
  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": "EBS Fast Snapshot Restore (FSR) eliminates the latency of I/O operations on first access by pre-warming the volume from the snapshot. This provides consistent high I/O performance immediately and minimizes cloning time."
