  "question": "A company has a multi-tier application that runs six front-end web servers in an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group in a single Availability Zone behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB). A solutions architect needs to modify the infrastructure to be highly available without modifying the application.\nWhich architecture should the solutions architect choose that provides high availability?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Create an Auto Scaling group that uses three instances across each of two Regions.",
    "B": "Modify the Auto Scaling group to use three instances across each of two Availability Zones.",
    "C": "Create an Auto Scaling template that can be used to quickly create more instances in another Region.",
    "D": "Change the ALB in front of the Amazon EC2 instances in a round-robin configuration to balance traffic to the web tier."
  },
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": "Spreading instances across multiple Availability Zones provides high availability within a region without application changes. Auto Scaling groups can launch instances in multiple AZs automatically. Multi-region requires application changes and is more complex than necessary."
}
