  "question": "A company is creating a new application that will store a large amount of data. The data will be analyzed hourly and will be modified by several Amazon EC2 Linux instances that are deployed across multiple Availability Zones. The needed amount of storage space will continue to grow for the next 6 months.\n\nWhich storage solution should a solutions architect recommend to meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Store the data in Amazon S3 Glacier. Update the S3 Glacier vault policy to allow access to the application instances.",
    "B": "Store the data in an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume. Mount the EBS volume on the application instances.",
    "C": "Store the data in an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file system. Mount the file system on the application instances.",
    "D": "Store the data in an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) Provisioned IOPS volume shared between the application instances."
  },
  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": "Amazon EFS provides a shared file system that can be mounted by multiple EC2 instances across multiple Availability Zones simultaneously. It automatically scales storage capacity as data grows, meeting all requirements. EBS volumes cannot be shared across AZs."
