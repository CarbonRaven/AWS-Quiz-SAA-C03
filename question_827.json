  "question": "A company is planning to deploy its application on an Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL Serverless v2 cluster. The application will receive large amounts of traffic. The company wants to optimize the storage performance of the cluster as the load on the application increases.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Configure the cluster to use the Aurora Standard storage configuration.",
    "B": "Configure the cluster storage type as Provisioned IOPS.",
    "C": "Configure the cluster storage type as General Purpose.",
    "D": "Configure the cluster to use the Aurora I/O-Optimized storage configuration."
  },
  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": "Aurora I/O-Optimized is cost-effective for I/O-intensive workloads as it provides predictable pricing without per-I/O charges. For applications with large amounts of traffic, I/O-Optimized can reduce costs by up to 40% compared to Standard."
