  "question": "A company has a large workload that runs every Friday evening. The workload runs on Amazon EC2 instances that are in two Availability Zones in the us-east-1 Region. Normally, the company must run no more than two instances at all times. However, the company wants to scale up to six instances each Friday to handle a regularly repeating increased workload.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Create a reminder in Amazon EventBridge to scale the instances.",
    "B": "Create an Auto Scaling group that has a scheduled action.",
    "C": "Create an Auto Scaling group that uses manual scaling.",
    "D": "Create an Auto Scaling group that uses automatic scaling."
  },
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": "Scheduled scaling in Auto Scaling groups allows you to set up recurring schedules to scale capacity at specific times. This is ideal for predictable, recurring workload patterns like every Friday evening, with minimal operational overhead."
}
