  "question": "A company is planning to migrate a TCP-based application into the company's VPC. The application is publicly accessible on a nonstandard TCP port through a hardware appliance in the company's data center. This public endpoint can process up to 3 million requests per second with low latency. The company requires the same level of performance for the new public endpoint in AWS.\n\nWhat should a solutions architect recommend to meet this requirement?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Deploy a Network Load Balancer (NLB). Configure the NLB to be publicly accessible over the TCP port that the application requires.",
    "B": "Deploy an Application Load Balancer (ALB). Configure the ALB to be publicly accessible over the TCP port that the application requires.",
    "C": "Deploy an Amazon CloudFront distribution that listens on the TCP port that the application requires. Use an Application Load Balancer as the origin.",
    "D": "Deploy an Amazon API Gateway API that is configured with the TCP port that the application requires. Configure AWS Lambda functions with provisioned concurrency to process the requests."
  },
  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": "Network Load Balancer operates at Layer 4 and is designed for TCP traffic with ultra-low latency. NLB can handle millions of requests per second. ALB is Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS only). API Gateway and CloudFront don't support arbitrary TCP ports."
