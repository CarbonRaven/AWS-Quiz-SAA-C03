  "question": "A company runs multiple workloads in its on-premises data center. The company's data center cannot scale fast enough to meet the company's expanding business needs. The company wants to collect usage and configuration data about the on-premises servers and workloads to plan a migration to AWS.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Set the home AWS Region in AWS Migration Hub. Use AWS Systems Manager to collect data about the on-premises servers.",
    "B": "Set the home AWS Region in AWS Migration Hub. Use AWS Application Discovery Service to collect data about the on-premises servers.",
    "C": "Use the AWS Schema Conversion Tool (AWS SCT) to create the relevant templates. Use AWS Trusted Advisor to collect data about the on-premises servers.",
    "D": "Use the AWS Schema Conversion Tool (AWS SCT) to create the relevant templates. Use AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) to collect data about the on-premises servers."
  },
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": "AWS Application Discovery Service collects configuration, usage, and behavior data from on-premises servers to help plan cloud migrations. AWS Migration Hub provides a single location to track migration progress. SCT and DMS are for database migrations, not general server discovery."
