  "question": "A company uses AWS Organizations to run workloads within multiple AWS accounts. A tagging policy adds department tags to AWS resources when the company creates tags.\n\nAn accounting team needs to determine spending on Amazon EC2 consumption. The accounting team must determine which departments are responsible for the costs regardless of AWS account. The accounting team has access to AWS Cost Explorer for all AWS accounts within the organization and needs to access all reports from Cost Explorer.\n\nWhich solution meets these requirements in the MOST operationally efficient way?",
  "options": {
    "A": "From the Organizations management account billing console, activate a user-defined cost allocation tag named department. Create one cost report in Cost Explorer grouping by tag name, and filter by EC2.",
    "B": "From the Organizations management account billing console, activate an AWS-defined cost allocation tag named department. Create one cost report in Cost Explorer grouping by tag name, and filter by EC2.",
    "C": "From the Organizations member account billing console, activate a user-defined cost allocation tag named department. Create one cost report in Cost Explorer grouping by the tag name, and filter by EC2.",
    "D": "From the Organizations member account billing console, activate an AWS-defined cost allocation tag named department. Create one cost report in Cost Explorer grouping by tag name, and filter by EC2."
  },
  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": "Cost allocation tags must be activated from the management account. Since the 'department' tag is created by the company's tagging policy, it's a user-defined tag (not AWS-defined). After activation, Cost Explorer can group costs by this tag across all accounts."
