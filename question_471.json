  "question": "A company is creating an application that runs on containers in a VPC. The application stores and accesses data in an Amazon S3 bucket. During the development phase, the application will store and access 1 TB of data in Amazon S3 each day. The company wants to minimize costs and wants to prevent traffic from traversing the internet whenever possible.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Enable S3 Intelligent-Tiering for the S3 bucket",
    "B": "Enable S3 Transfer Acceleration for the S3 bucket",
    "C": "Create a gateway VPC endpoint for Amazon S3. Associate this endpoint with all route tables in the VPC",
    "D": "Create an interface endpoint for Amazon S3 in the VPC. Associate this endpoint with all route tables in the VPC"
  },
  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": "A gateway VPC endpoint for S3 is free and routes S3 traffic through the AWS network instead of the internet. Interface endpoints have hourly and data processing charges. Gateway endpoints are the cost-effective solution for S3 access from a VPC."
