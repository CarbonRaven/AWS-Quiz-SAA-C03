  "question": "A company has a web server running on an Amazon EC2 instance in a public subnet with an Elastic IP address. The default security group is assigned to the EC2 instance. The default network ACL has been modified to block all traffic. A solutions architect needs to make the web server accessible from everywhere on port 443.\nWhich combination of steps will accomplish this task? (Choose two.)",
  "options": {
    "A": "Create a security group with a rule to allow TCP port 443 from source 0.0.0.0/0.",
    "B": "Create a security group with a rule to allow TCP port 443 to destination 0.0.0.0/0.",
    "C": "Update the network ACL to allow TCP port 443 from source 0.0.0.0/0.",
    "D": "Update the network ACL to allow inbound/outbound TCP port 443 from source 0.0.0.0/0 and to destination 0.0.0.0/0.",
    "E": "Update the network ACL to allow inbound TCP port 443 from source 0.0.0.0/0 and outbound TCP port 32768-65535 to destination 0.0.0.0/0."
  },
  "correct_answer": ["A", "E"],
  "explanation": "Security groups need inbound rule for port 443 from 0.0.0.0/0 (A). NACLs are stateless, so need both inbound port 443 AND outbound ephemeral ports (32768-65535) for return traffic (E). Option D is incorrect because outbound should be ephemeral ports, not 443."
