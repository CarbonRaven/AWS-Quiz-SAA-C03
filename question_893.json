  "question": "A company wants to isolate its workloads by creating an AWS account for each workload. The company needs a solution that centrally manages networking components for the workloads. The solution also must create accounts with automatic security controls (guardrails).\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Use AWS Control Tower to deploy accounts. Create a networking account that has a VPC with private subnets and public subnets. Use AWS Resource Access Manager (AWS RAM) to share the subnets with the workload accounts.",
    "B": "Use AWS Organizations to deploy accounts. Create a networking account that has a VPC with private subnets and public subnets. Use AWS Resource Access Manager (AWS RAM) to share the subnets with the workload accounts.",
    "C": "Use AWS Control Tower to deploy accounts. Deploy a VPC in each workload account. Configure each VPC to route through an inspection VPC by using a transit gateway attachment.",
    "D": "Use AWS Organizations to deploy accounts. Deploy a VPC in each workload account. Configure each VPC to route through an inspection VPC by using a transit gateway attachment."
  },
  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": "AWS Control Tower provides automatic account provisioning with guardrails (security controls). Combined with RAM for subnet sharing, this provides centralized networking with the least operational overhead. Organizations alone doesn't provide automatic guardrails."
}
