  "question": "A company's security team requests that network traffic be captured in VPC Flow Logs. The logs will be frequently accessed for 90 days and then accessed intermittently.\nWhat should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements when configuring the logs?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Use Amazon CloudWatch as the target. Set the CloudWatch log group with an expiration of 90 days.",
    "B": "Use Amazon Kinesis as the target. Configure the Kinesis stream to always retain the logs for 90 days.",
    "C": "Use AWS CloudTrail as the target. Configure CloudTrail to save to an Amazon S3 bucket, and enable S3 Intelligent-Tiering.",
    "D": "Use Amazon S3 as the target. Enable an S3 Lifecycle policy to transition the logs to S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) after 90 days."
  },
  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": "S3 is a valid destination for VPC Flow Logs. S3 Standard provides frequent access for the first 90 days, then lifecycle policy transitions to S3 Standard-IA for cost-effective intermittent access. CloudWatch Log expiration would delete logs, not transition them. CloudTrail is not a Flow Logs target."
