  "question": "A company hosts its application in the AWS Cloud. The application runs on Amazon EC2 instances behind an Elastic Load Balancer in an Auto Scaling group and with an Amazon DynamoDB table. The company wants to ensure the application can be made available in another AWS Region with minimal downtime.\n\nWhat should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements with the LEAST amount of downtime?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Create an Auto Scaling group and a load balancer in the disaster recovery Region. Configure the DynamoDB table as a global table. Configure DNS failover to point to the new disaster recovery Region's load balancer.",
    "B": "Create an AWS CloudFormation template to create EC2 instances, load balancers, and DynamoDB tables to be launched when needed. Configure DNS failover to point to the new disaster recovery Region's load balancer.",
    "C": "Create an AWS CloudFormation template to create EC2 instances and a load balancer to be launched when needed. Configure the DynamoDB table as a global table. Configure DNS failover to point to the new disaster recovery Region's load balancer.",
    "D": "Create an Auto Scaling group and load balancer in the disaster recovery Region. Configure the DynamoDB table as a global table. Create an Amazon CloudWatch alarm to trigger an AWS Lambda function that updates Amazon Route 53 pointing to the disaster recovery load balancer."
  },
  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": "Pre-provisioned infrastructure (Auto Scaling group, load balancer) in DR region provides fastest failover. DynamoDB global tables provide multi-region data replication. DNS failover with Route 53 automatically routes traffic when primary fails. CloudFormation provisioning on-demand adds delay. CloudWatch/Lambda automation is more complex than native DNS failover."
