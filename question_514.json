  "question": "A company is running a microservices application on Amazon EC2 instances. The company wants to migrate the application to an Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) cluster for scalability. The company must configure the Amazon EKS control plane with endpoint private access set to true and endpoint public access set to false to maintain security compliance. The company must also put the data plane in private subnets. However, the company has received error notifications because the node cannot join the cluster.\n\nWhich solution will allow the node to join the cluster?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Grant the required permission in AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to the AmazonEKSNodeRole IAM role.",
    "B": "Create interface VPC endpoints to allow nodes to access the control plane.",
    "C": "Recreate nodes in the public subnet. Restrict security groups for EC2 nodes.",
    "D": "Allow outbound traffic in the security group of the nodes."
  },
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": "When EKS private endpoint access is enabled and public access is disabled, nodes in private subnets need VPC endpoints to communicate with the EKS control plane. Interface VPC endpoints for EKS API and other required services allow private network access."
}
