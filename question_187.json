  "question": "A company is developing an ecommerce application that will consist of a load-balanced front end, a container-based application, and a relational database. A solutions architect needs to create a highly available solution that operates with as little manual intervention as possible.\nWhich solutions meet these requirements? (Choose two.)",
  "options": {
    "A": "Create an Amazon RDS DB instance in Multi-AZ mode.",
    "B": "Create an Amazon RDS DB instance and one or more replicas in another Availability Zone.",
    "C": "Create an Amazon EC2 instance-based Docker cluster to handle the dynamic application load.",
    "D": "Create an Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) cluster with a Fargate launch type to handle the dynamic application load.",
    "E": "Create an Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) cluster with an Amazon EC2 launch type to handle the dynamic application load."
  },
  "correct_answer": ["A", "D"],
  "explanation": "RDS Multi-AZ provides automatic failover for high availability with minimal manual intervention. ECS with Fargate eliminates the need to manage underlying EC2 instances for containers. Both are fully managed services that reduce operational overhead."
