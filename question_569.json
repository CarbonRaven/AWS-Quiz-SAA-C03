  "question": "An Amazon EventBridge rule targets a third-party API. The third-party API has not received any incoming traffic.

  "options": {
    "A": "Check for metrics in Amazon CloudWatch in the namespace for AWS/Events.",
    "B": "Review events in the Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) dead-letter queue.",
    "C": "Check for the events in Amazon CloudWatch Logs.",
    "D": "Check the trails in AWS CloudTrail for the EventBridge events."
  },
  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": "EventBridge publishes metrics to CloudWatch under the AWS/Events namespace. Metrics like Invocations, FailedInvocations, and TriggeredRules help determine if rules are matching and targets are being invoked successfully."
