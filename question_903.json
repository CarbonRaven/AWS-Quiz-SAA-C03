  "options": {
    "A": "Create dedicated S3 access points and access point policies for each application.",
    "B": "Create an S3 Batch Operations job to set the ACL permissions for each object in the S3 bucket.",
    "C": "Replicate the objects in the S3 bucket to new S3 buckets for each application. Create replication rules by prefix.",
    "D": "Replicate the objects in the S3 bucket to new S3 buckets for each application. Create dedicated S3 access points for each application."
