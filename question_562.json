  "question": "A solutions architect needs to ensure that API calls to Amazon DynamoDB from Amazon EC2 instances in a VPC do not travel across the internet.\n\nWhich combination of steps should the solutions architect take to meet this requirement? (Choose two.)",
  "options": {
    "A": "Create a route table entry for the endpoint.",
    "B": "Create a gateway endpoint for DynamoDB.",
    "C": "Create an interface endpoint for Amazon EC2.",
    "D": "Create an elastic network interface for the endpoint in each of the subnets of the VPC.",
    "E": "Create a security group entry in the endpoint's security group to provide access."
  },
  "correct_answer": ["A", "B"],
  "explanation": "DynamoDB uses a gateway endpoint (not interface endpoint). Gateway endpoints require route table entries to direct traffic to the endpoint. Unlike interface endpoints, gateway endpoints don't use ENIs or security groups."
}
