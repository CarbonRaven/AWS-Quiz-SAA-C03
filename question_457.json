The company wants the IdP to authenticate application users while the users use the application to transfer data. The company must use Applicability Statement 2 (AS2) protocol.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Use AWS DataSync to transfer the data. Create an AWS Lambda function for IdP authentication.",
    "B": "Use Amazon AppFlow flows to transfer the data. Create an Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) task for IdP authentication.",
    "C": "Use AWS Transfer Family to transfer the data. Create an AWS Lambda function for IdP authentication.",
    "D": "Use AWS Storage Gateway to transfer the data. Create an Amazon Cognito identity pool for IdP authentication."
  },
  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": "AWS Transfer Family supports AS2 protocol for B2B data transfers and can integrate with custom identity providers through Lambda functions. This combination allows the company to use their existing IdP while meeting the AS2 protocol requirement."
