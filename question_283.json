  "question": "A research company runs experiments that are powered by a simulation application and a visualization application. The simulation application runs on Linux and outputs intermediate data to an NFS share every 5 minutes. The visualization application is a Windows desktop application that displays the simulation output and requires an SMB file system.\n\nThe company maintains two synchronized file systems. This strategy is causing data duplication and inefficient resource usage. The company needs to migrate the applications to AWS without making code changes to either application.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Migrate both applications to AWS Lambda. Create an Amazon S3 bucket to exchange data between the applications.",
    "B": "Migrate both applications to Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS). Configure Amazon FSx File Gateway for storage.",
    "C": "Migrate the simulation application to Linux Amazon EC2 instances. Migrate the visualization application to Windows EC2 instances. Configure Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) to exchange data between the applications.",
    "D": "Migrate the simulation application to Linux Amazon EC2 instances. Migrate the visualization application to Windows EC2 instances. Configure Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP for storage."
  },
  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": "FSx for NetApp ONTAP supports both NFS (for Linux) and SMB (for Windows) protocols simultaneously from the same file system. This eliminates data duplication while requiring no code changes. Lambda can't run desktop applications. S3 and SQS don't provide NFS/SMB file system interfaces. FSx File Gateway doesn't support multi-protocol access like ONTAP."
