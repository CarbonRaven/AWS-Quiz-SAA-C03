  "question": "A solutions architect is creating a new Amazon CloudFront distribution for an application. Some of the information submitted by users is sensitive. The application uses HTTPS but needs another layer of security. The sensitive information should be protected throughout the entire application stack, and access to the information should be restricted to certain applications.\nWhich action should the solutions architect take?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Configure a CloudFront signed URL.",
    "B": "Configure a CloudFront signed cookie.",
    "C": "Configure a CloudFront field-level encryption profile.",
    "D": "Configure CloudFront and set the Origin Protocol Policy setting to HTTPS Only for the Viewer Protocol Policy."
  },
  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": "Field-level encryption adds an additional layer of security by encrypting specific data fields at the edge using asymmetric encryption. Only applications with the private key can decrypt the data, protecting sensitive information throughout the entire stack, even from the origin server."
