  "question": "As part of budget planning, management wants a report of AWS billed items listed by user. The data will be used to create department budgets. A solutions architect needs to determine the most efficient way to obtain this report information.\n\nWhich solution meets these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Run a query with Amazon Athena to generate the report.",
    "B": "Create a report in Cost Explorer and download the report.",
    "C": "Access the bill details from the billing dashboard and download the bill.",
    "D": "Modify a cost budget in AWS Budgets to alert with Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES)."
  },
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": "AWS Cost Explorer provides cost reports that can be filtered and grouped by various dimensions including user/IAM identity. Reports can be downloaded for budget planning. Athena requires setting up Cost and Usage Reports first. Billing dashboard shows account-level bills, not user-level breakdown. AWS Budgets is for alerts, not generating detailed reports."
