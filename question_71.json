  "question": "A company runs a shopping application that uses Amazon DynamoDB to store customer information. In case of data corruption, a solutions architect needs to design a solution that meets a recovery point objective (RPO) of 15 minutes and a recovery time objective (RTO) of 1 hour.\nWhat should the solutions architect recommend to meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Configure DynamoDB global tables. For RPO recovery, point the application to a different AWS Region.",
    "B": "Configure DynamoDB point-in-time recovery. For RPO recovery, restore to the desired point in time.",
    "C": "Export the DynamoDB data to Amazon S3 Glacier on a daily basis. For RPO recovery, import the data from S3 Glacier to DynamoDB.",
    "D": "Schedule Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) snapshots for the DynamoDB table every 15 minutes. For RPO recovery, restore the DynamoDB table by using the EBS snapshot."
  },
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": "DynamoDB point-in-time recovery (PITR) provides continuous backups and allows restoration to any second within the last 35 days, easily meeting a 15-minute RPO. Restoration typically completes within the 1-hour RTO."
