  "question": "A company has several on-premises Internet Small Computer Systems Interface (ISCSI) network storage servers. The company wants to reduce the number of these servers by moving to the AWS Cloud. A solutions architect must provide low-latency access to frequently used data and reduce the dependency on on-premises servers with a minimal number of infrastructure changes.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Deploy an Amazon S3 File Gateway.",
    "B": "Deploy Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) storage with backups to Amazon S3.",
    "C": "Deploy an AWS Storage Gateway volume gateway that is configured with stored volumes.",
    "D": "Deploy an AWS Storage Gateway volume gateway that is configured with cached volumes."
  },
  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": "Volume Gateway with cached volumes provides iSCSI interface compatibility, stores frequently accessed data locally for low-latency access, and stores primary data in S3. This reduces on-premises storage dependency while maintaining low-latency access to hot data."
}
