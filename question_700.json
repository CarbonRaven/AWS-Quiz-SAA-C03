  "question": "A gaming company wants to launch a new internet-facing application in multiple AWS Regions. The application will use the TCP and UDP protocols for communication. The company needs to provide high availability and minimum latency for global users.\n\nWhich combination of actions should a solutions architect take to meet these requirements? (Choose two.)",
  "options": {
    "A": "Create internal Network Load Balancers in front of the application in each Region.",
    "B": "Create external Application Load Balancers in front of the application in each Region.",
    "C": "Create an AWS Global Accelerator accelerator to route traffic to the load balancers in each Region.",
    "D": "Configure Amazon Route 53 to use a geolocation routing policy to distribute the traffic.",
    "E": "Configure Amazon CloudFront to handle the traffic and route requests to the application in each Region"
  },
  "correct_answer": ["A", "C"],
  "explanation": "Network Load Balancers support both TCP and UDP protocols required by the application. AWS Global Accelerator provides optimal routing to the nearest healthy endpoint with static anycast IPs, reducing latency for global users. ALB only supports HTTP/HTTPS. CloudFront is for HTTP content delivery."
