  "question": "A company has a popular gaming platform running on AWS. The application is sensitive to latency because latency can impact the user experience and introduce unfair advantages to some players. The application is deployed in every AWS Region. It runs on Amazon EC2 instances that are part of Auto Scaling groups configured behind Application Load Balancers (ALBs). A solutions architect needs to implement a mechanism to monitor the health of the application and redirect traffic to healthy endpoints.\n\nWhich solution meets these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Configure an accelerator in AWS Global Accelerator. Add a listener for the port that the application listens on, and attach it to a Regional endpoint in each Region. Add the ALB as the endpoint.",
    "B": "Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution and specify the ALB as the origin server. Configure the cache behavior to use origin cache headers. Use AWS Lambda functions to optimize the traffic.",
    "C": "Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution and specify Amazon S3 as the origin server. Configure the cache behavior to use origin cache headers. Use AWS Lambda functions to optimize the traffic.",
    "D": "Configure an Amazon DynamoDB database to serve as the data store for the application. Create a DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) cluster to act as the in-memory cache for DynamoDB hosting the application data."
  },
  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": "AWS Global Accelerator provides static IP addresses and routes traffic to optimal endpoints based on health, geography, and routing policies. It monitors endpoint health and automatically redirects traffic away from unhealthy endpoints. This reduces latency for gaming applications. CloudFront is for content caching. DAX is a DynamoDB cache, not a traffic routing solution."
