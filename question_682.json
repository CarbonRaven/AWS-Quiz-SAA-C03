  "question": "A company needs a solution to enforce data encryption at rest on Amazon EC2 instances. The solution must automatically identify noncompliant resources and enforce compliance policies on findings.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST administrative overhead?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Use an IAM policy that allows users to create only encrypted Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes. Use AWS Config and AWS Systems Manager to automate the detection and remediation of unencrypted EBS volumes.",
    "B": "Use AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) to manage access to encrypted Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes. Use AWS Lambda and Amazon EventBridge to automate the detection and remediation of unencrypted EBS volumes.",
    "C": "Use Amazon Macie to detect unencrypted Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes. Use AWS Systems Manager Automation rules to automatically encrypt existing and new EBS volumes.",
    "D": "Use Amazon inspector to detect unencrypted Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes. Use AWS Systems Manager Automation rules to automatically encrypt existing and new EBS volumes."
  },
  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": "AWS Config has managed rules to detect unencrypted EBS volumes and can trigger Systems Manager Automation for remediation. This combination provides automatic detection and enforcement with minimal administrative overhead. Macie is for S3 data, and Inspector is for vulnerabilities."
