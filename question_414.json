  "question": "A company has a business system that generates hundreds of reports each day. The business system saves the reports to a network share in CSV format. The company needs to store this data in the AWS Cloud in near-real time for analysis.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST administrative overhead?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Use AWS DataSync to transfer the files to Amazon S3. Create a scheduled task that runs at the end of each day.",
    "B": "Create an Amazon S3 File Gateway. Update the business system to use a new network share from the S3 File Gateway.",
    "C": "Use AWS DataSync to transfer the files to Amazon S3. Create an application that uses the DataSync API in the automation workflow.",
    "D": "Deploy an AWS Transfer for SFTP endpoint. Create a script that checks for new files on the network share and uploads the new files by using SFTP."
  },
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": "S3 File Gateway provides a network share that automatically syncs files to S3 in near-real time. It requires minimal changes - just update the share path. DataSync scheduled tasks don't provide near-real time transfer. Custom DataSync API applications add development overhead. SFTP with scripts requires additional development and maintenance."
