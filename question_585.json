  "question": "A solutions architect is designing a disaster recovery (DR) strategy to provide Amazon EC2 capacity in a failover AWS Region. Business requirements state that the DR strategy must meet capacity in the failover Region.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Purchase On-Demand Instances in the failover Region.",
    "B": "Purchase an EC2 Savings Plan in the failover Region.",
    "C": "Purchase regional Reserved Instances in the failover Region.",
    "D": "Purchase a Capacity Reservation in the failover Region."
  },
  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": "Capacity Reservations guarantee EC2 capacity in a specific Availability Zone for any duration. This ensures capacity is available during failover. On-Demand doesn't guarantee capacity. Reserved Instances and Savings Plans are for cost optimization, not capacity reservation."
}
