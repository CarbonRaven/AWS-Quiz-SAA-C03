  "question": "A company recently migrated a monolithic application to an Amazon EC2 instance and Amazon RDS. The application has tightly coupled modules. The existing design of the application gives the application the ability to run on only a single EC2 instance.\n\nThe company has noticed high CPU utilization on the EC2 instance during peak usage times. The high CPU utilization corresponds to degraded performance on Amazon RDS for read requests. The company wants to reduce the high CPU utilization and improve read request performance.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Resize the EC2 instance to an EC2 instance type that has more CPU capacity. Configure an Auto Scaling group with a minimum and maximum size of 1. Configure an RDS read replica for read requests.",
    "B": "Resize the EC2 instance to an EC2 instance type that has more CPU capacity. Configure an Auto Scaling group with a minimum and maximum size of 1. Add an RDS read replica and redirect all read/write traffic to the replica.",
    "C": "Configure an Auto Scaling group with a minimum size of 1 and maximum size of 2. Resize the RDS DB instance to an instance type that has more CPU capacity.",
    "D": "Resize the EC2 instance to an EC2 instance type that has more CPU capacity. Configure an Auto Scaling group with a minimum and maximum size of 1. Resize the RDS DB instance to an instance type that has more CPU capacity."
  },
  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": "Since the app can only run on a single instance, vertical scaling (larger EC2) addresses CPU issues. An RDS read replica offloads read traffic, improving read performance. Auto Scaling with min/max=1 provides recovery capability."
