  "question": "A gaming company is designing a highly available architecture. The application runs on a modified Linux kernel and supports only UDP-based traffic. The company needs the front-end tier to provide the best possible user experience. That tier must have low latency, route traffic to the nearest edge location, and provide static IP addresses for entry into the application endpoints.\nWhat should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Configure Amazon Route 53 to forward requests to an Application Load Balancer. Use AWS Lambda for the application in AWS Application Auto Scaling.",
    "B": "Configure Amazon CloudFront to forward requests to a Network Load Balancer. Use AWS Lambda for the application in an AWS Application Auto Scaling group.",
    "C": "Configure AWS Global Accelerator to forward requests to a Network Load Balancer. Use Amazon EC2 instances for the application in an EC2 Auto Scaling group.",
    "D": "Configure Amazon API Gateway to forward requests to an Application Load Balancer. Use Amazon EC2 instances for the application in an EC2 Auto Scaling group."
  },
  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": "Global Accelerator provides static IP addresses and routes traffic to the nearest edge location with low latency. NLB supports UDP traffic (ALB only supports HTTP/HTTPS). EC2 is required for modified Linux kernel. Lambda doesn't support UDP or custom kernels."
}
