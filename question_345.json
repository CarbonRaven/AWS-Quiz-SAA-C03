  "question": "A company wants to restrict access to the content of one of its main web applications and to protect the content by using authorization techniques available on AWS. The company wants to implement a serverless architecture and an authentication solution for fewer than 100 users. The solution needs to integrate with the main web application and serve web content globally. The solution must also scale as the company's user base grows while providing the lowest login latency possible.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Use Amazon Cognito for authentication. Use Lambda@Edge for authorization. Use Amazon CloudFront to serve the web application globally.",
    "B": "Use AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory for authentication. Use AWS Lambda for authorization. Use an Application Load Balancer to serve the web application globally.",
    "C": "Use Amazon Cognito for authentication. Use AWS Lambda for authorization. Use Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration to serve the web application globally.",
    "D": "Use AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory for authentication. Use Lambda@Edge for authorization. Use AWS Elastic Beanstalk to serve the web application globally."
  },
  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": "Cognito is cost-effective for small user bases (<100) and serverless. Lambda@Edge provides low-latency authorization at edge locations. CloudFront serves content globally with low latency. Directory Service is expensive for small user counts. ALB and Elastic Beanstalk aren't serverless. S3 Transfer Acceleration is for uploads, not serving web content."
