  "question": "A company deploys its applications on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) behind an Application Load Balancer in an AWS Region. The application needs to store data in a PostgreSQL database engine. The company wants the data in the database to be highly available. The company also needs increased capacity for read workloads.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements with the MOST operational efficiency?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Create an Amazon DynamoDB database table configured with global tables.",
    "B": "Create an Amazon RDS database with Multi-AZ deployments.",
    "C": "Create an Amazon RDS database with Multi-AZ DB cluster deployment.",
    "D": "Create an Amazon RDS database configured with cross-Region read replicas."
  },
  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": "Multi-AZ DB cluster deployment provides high availability with one primary and two readable standby instances across different AZs. This provides both high availability and increased read capacity. DynamoDB is not PostgreSQL-compatible."
}
