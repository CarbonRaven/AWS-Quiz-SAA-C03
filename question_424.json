  "question": "A company is running a custom application on Amazon EC2 On-Demand Instances. The application has frontend nodes that need to run 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and backend nodes that need to run only for a short time based on workload. The number of backend nodes varies during the day.\n\nThe company needs to scale out and scale in more instances based on workload.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Use Reserved Instances for the frontend nodes. Use AWS Fargate for the backend nodes.",
    "B": "Use Reserved Instances for the frontend nodes. Use Spot Instances for the backend nodes.",
    "C": "Use Spot Instances for the frontend nodes. Use Reserved Instances for the backend nodes.",
    "D": "Use Spot Instances for the frontend nodes. Use AWS Fargate for the backend nodes."
  },
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": "Reserved Instances for 24/7 frontend nodes provide significant cost savings. Spot Instances for variable backend workloads are highly cost-effective for interruptible workloads. Spot for frontend risks availability. Reserved for backends wastes money when not running. Fargate may cost more than Spot EC2 for short-running workloads."
