  "question": "A group requires permissions to list an Amazon S3 bucket and delete objects from that bucket. An administrator has created the following IAM policy to provide access to the bucket and applied that policy to the group. The group is not able to delete objects in the bucket. The company follows least-privilege access rules.\n\nWhich statement should a solutions architect add to the policy to correct bucket access?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Effect: Allow, Action: s3:DeleteObject, Resource: arn:aws:s3:::bucket-name",
    "B": "Effect: Allow, Action: s3:DeleteObject, Resource: arn:aws:s3:::bucket-name/*",
    "C": "Effect: Allow, Action: s3:*, Resource: arn:aws:s3:::bucket-name/*",
    "D": "Effect: Allow, Action: s3:DeleteObject, Resource: arn:aws:s3:::bucket-name/*"
  },
  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": "The s3:DeleteObject action requires the resource ARN to include /* to reference objects within the bucket. The bucket ARN without /* refers to the bucket itself, not its objects. Using s3:* would violate least-privilege principles."
}
