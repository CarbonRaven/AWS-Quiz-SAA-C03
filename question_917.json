  "options": {
    "A": "Use a NAT gateway to manage web traffic. Use Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups to receive, process, and store processed customer orders. Use an AWS Lambda function to capture and store unprocessed orders.",
    "B": "Use a Network Load Balancer (NLB) to manage web traffic. Use an Application Load Balancer to receive customer orders from the NLB. Use Amazon Redshift with a Multi-AZ deployment to store unprocessed and processed customer orders.",
    "C": "Use a Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB) to manage web traffic. Use Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) to receive and process customer orders. Use the GWLB to capture and store unprocessed orders. Use Amazon DynamoDB to store processed customer orders.",
    "D": "Use an Application Load Balancer to manage web traffic. Use Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups to receive and process customer orders. Use Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) to store unprocessed orders. Use Amazon RDS with a Multi-AZ deployment to store processed customer orders."
