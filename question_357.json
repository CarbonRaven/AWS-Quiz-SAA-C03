  "question": "A gaming company is moving its public scoreboard from a data center to the AWS Cloud. The company hosts the website on Amazon EC2 Windows Server instances behind an Application Load Balancer. The company needs a highly available storage solution for the application. The application consists of static files and dynamic server-side code.\n\nWhich combination of steps should a solutions architect take to meet these requirements? (Choose two.)",
  "options": {
    "A": "Store the static files on Amazon S3. Use Amazon CloudFront to cache objects at the edge.",
    "B": "Store the static files on Amazon S3. Use Amazon ElastiCache to cache objects at the edge.",
    "C": "Store the server-side code on Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS). Mount the EFS volume on each EC2 instance to share the files.",
    "D": "Store the server-side code on Amazon FSx for Windows File Server. Mount the FSx for Windows File Server volume on each EC2 instance to share the files.",
    "E": "Store the server-side code on a General Purpose SSD (gp2) Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume. Mount the EBS volume on each EC2 instance to share the files."
  },
  "correct_answer": ["A", "D"],
  "explanation": "S3 with CloudFront (A) provides highly available static file storage with edge caching. FSx for Windows File Server (D) provides shared Windows-compatible storage for server-side code across EC2 instances. EFS doesn't support Windows. ElastiCache is for data caching, not edge content delivery. EBS volumes can't be shared across instances."
