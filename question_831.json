  "question": "A company needs a secure connection between its on-premises environment and AWS. This connection does not need high bandwidth and will handle a small amount of traffic. The connection should be set up quickly.\n\nWhat is the MOST cost-effective method to establish this type of connection?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Implement a client VPN.",
    "B": "Implement AWS Direct Connect.",
    "C": "Implement a bastion host on Amazon EC2.",
    "D": "Implement an AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection."
  },
  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": "AWS Site-to-Site VPN provides secure connectivity between on-premises and AWS, can be set up quickly (within minutes), and is cost-effective for low bandwidth requirements. Direct Connect is expensive and takes longer to provision."
