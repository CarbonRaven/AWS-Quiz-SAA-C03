  "question": "A company has a web application that runs on premises. The application experiences latency issues during peak hours. The latency issues occur twice each month. At the start of a latency issue, the application's CPU utilization immediately increases to 10 times its normal amount.\n\nThe company wants to migrate the application to AWS to improve latency. The company also wants to scale the application automatically when application demand increases. The company will use AWS Elastic Beanstalk for application deployment.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Configure an Elastic Beanstalk environment to use burstable performance instances in unlimited mode. Configure the environment to scale based on requests.",
    "B": "Configure an Elastic Beanstalk environment to use compute optimized instances. Configure the environment to scale based on requests.",
    "C": "Configure an Elastic Beanstalk environment to use compute optimized instances. Configure the environment to scale on a schedule.",
    "D": "Configure an Elastic Beanstalk environment to use burstable performance instances in unlimited mode. Configure the environment to scale on predictive metrics."
  },
  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": "Burstable performance instances in unlimited mode can handle CPU spikes (10x normal) without throttling. Request-based scaling responds dynamically to actual demand. This combination handles both the burst CPU requirement and automatic scaling based on real-time traffic."
}
