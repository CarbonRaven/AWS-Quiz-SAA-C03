  "question": "A solutions architect needs to connect a company's corporate network to its VPC to allow on-premises access to its AWS resources. The solution must provide encryption of all traffic between the corporate network and the VPC at the network layer and the session layer. The solution also must provide security controls to prevent unrestricted access between AWS and the on-premises systems.\n\nWhich solution meets these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Configure AWS Direct Connect to connect to the VPC. Configure the VPC route tables to allow and deny traffic between AWS and on premises as required.",
    "B": "Create an IAM policy to allow access to the AWS Management Console only from a defined set of corporate IP addresses. Restrict user access based on job responsibility by using an IAM policy and roles.",
    "C": "Configure AWS Site-to-Site VPN to connect to the VPC. Configure route table entries to direct traffic from on premises to the VPC. Configure instance security groups and network ACLs to allow only required traffic from on premises.",
    "D": "Configure AWS Transit Gateway to connect to the VPC. Configure route table entries to direct traffic from on premises to the VPC. Configure instance security groups and network ACLs to allow only required traffic from on premises."
  },
  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": "Site-to-Site VPN provides IPsec encryption at the network layer. Security groups and NACLs provide security controls to prevent unrestricted access. Direct Connect alone doesn't provide encryption."
}
