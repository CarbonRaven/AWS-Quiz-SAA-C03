  "question": "A company is developing software that uses a PostgreSQL database schema. The company needs to configure multiple development environments and databases for the company's developers. On average, each development environment is used for half of the 8-hour workday.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Configure each development environment with its own Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL database",
    "B": "Configure each development environment with its own Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL Single-AZ DB instances",
    "C": "Configure each development environment with its own Amazon Aurora On-Demand PostgreSQL-Compatible database",
    "D": "Configure each development environment with its own Amazon S3 bucket by using Amazon S3 Object Select"
  },
  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": "Aurora Serverless (On-Demand) automatically starts, stops, and scales capacity based on application needs. Since environments are used only half the workday, Aurora Serverless only charges for actual usage, making it the most cost-effective option for variable, intermittent workloads."
