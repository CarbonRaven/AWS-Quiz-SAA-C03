  "question": "A data analytics company has 80 offices that are distributed globally. Each office hosts 1 PB of data and has between 1 and 2 Gbps of internet bandwidth.\n\nThe company needs to perform a one-time migration of a large amount of data from its offices to Amazon S3. The company must complete the migration within 4 weeks.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Establish a new 10 Gbps AWS Direct Connect connection to each office. Transfer the data to Amazon S3.",
    "B": "Use multiple AWS Snowball Edge storage-optimized devices to store and transfer the data to Amazon S3.",
    "C": "Use an AWS Snowmobile to store and transfer the data to Amazon S3.",
    "D": "Set up an AWS Storage Gateway Volume Gateway to transfer the data to Amazon S3."
  },
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": "With 80 offices each having 1 PB (total 80 PB), AWS Snowball Edge devices are the most cost-effective solution. Each Snowball Edge holds up to 80 TB, and devices can be shipped to multiple locations in parallel. Snowmobile (100 PB capacity) is for exabyte-scale single-location transfers. Direct Connect takes too long to provision for a 4-week deadline."
