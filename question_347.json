  "question": "A company has an application that is running on Amazon EC2 instances. A solutions architect has standardized the company on a particular instance family and various instance sizes based on the current needs of the company.\n\nThe company wants to maximize cost savings for the application over the next 3 years. The company needs to be able to change the instance family and sizes in the next 6 months based on application popularity and usage.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Compute Savings Plan",
    "B": "EC2 Instance Savings Plan",
    "C": "Zonal Reserved Instances",
    "D": "Standard Reserved Instances"
  },
  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": "Compute Savings Plans provide flexibility to change instance family, size, OS, tenancy, and Region while still providing significant savings. EC2 Instance Savings Plans are tied to a specific instance family. Reserved Instances (both types) are tied to specific instance types and don't allow family changes."
