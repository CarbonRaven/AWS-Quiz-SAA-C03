  "question": "A company hosts a website on Amazon EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB). The website serves static content. Website traffic is increasing, and the company is concerned about a potential increase in cost.\n\nWhich solution will reduce costs?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution to cache static files at edge locations",
    "B": "Create an Amazon ElastiCache cluster. Connect the ALB to the ElastiCache cluster to serve cached files",
    "C": "Create an AWS WAF web ACL and associate it with the ALB. Add a rule to the web ACL to cache static files",
    "D": "Create a second ALB in an alternative AWS Region. Route user traffic to the closest Region to minimize data transfer costs"
  },
  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": "CloudFront caches static content at edge locations globally, reducing load on EC2 instances and ALB, lowering costs. ElastiCache is for application-level caching, not static content delivery. WAF doesn't cache content. Multiple ALBs increase costs."
}
