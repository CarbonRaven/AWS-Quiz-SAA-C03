  "question": "A company is moving its on-premises Oracle database to Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL. The database has several applications that write to the same tables. The applications need to be migrated one by one with a month in between each migration. Management has expressed concerns that the database has a high number of reads and writes. The data must be kept in sync across both databases throughout the migration.\nWhat should a solutions architect recommend?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Use AWS DataSync for the initial migration. Use AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) to create a change data capture (CDC) replication task and a table mapping to select all tables.",
    "B": "Use AWS DataSync for the initial migration. Use AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) to create a full load plus change data capture (CDC) replication task and a table mapping to select all tables.",
    "C": "Use the AWS Schema Conversion Tool with AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) using a memory optimized replication instance. Create a full load plus change data capture (CDC) replication task and a table mapping to select all tables.",
    "D": "Use the AWS Schema Conversion Tool with AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) using a compute optimized replication instance. Create a full load plus change data capture (CDC) replication task and a table mapping to select the largest tables."
  },
  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": "Schema Conversion Tool is needed for heterogeneous migrations (Oracle to PostgreSQL). DMS with full load + CDC handles initial migration and ongoing replication. Memory-optimized instances are recommended for high transaction workloads. All tables should be migrated, not just largest."
