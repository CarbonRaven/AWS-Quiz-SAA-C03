  "question": "A company is developing machine learning (ML) models on AWS. The company is developing the ML models as independent microservices. The microservices fetch approximately 1 GB of model data from Amazon S3 at startup and load the data into memory. Users access the ML models through an asynchronous API. Users can send a request or a batch of requests.\n\nThe company provides the ML models to hundreds of users. The usage patterns for the models are irregular. Some models are not used for days or weeks. Other models receive batches of thousands of requests at a time.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Direct the requests from the API to a Network Load Balancer (NLB). Deploy the ML models as AWS Lambda functions that the NLB will invoke. Use auto scaling to scale the Lambda functions based on the traffic that the NLB receives.",
    "B": "Direct the requests from the API to an Application Load Balancer (ALB). Deploy the ML models as Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) services that the ALB will invoke. Use auto scaling to scale the ECS cluster instances based on the traffic that the ALB receives.",
    "C": "Direct the requests from the API into an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Deploy the ML models as AWS Lambda functions that SQS events will invoke. Use auto scaling to increase the number of vCPUs for the Lambda functions based on the size of the SQS queue.",
    "D": "Direct the requests from the API into an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Deploy the ML models as Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) services that read from the queue. Use auto scaling for Amazon ECS to scale both the cluster capacity and number of the services based on the size of the SQS queue."
  },
  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": "SQS provides asynchronous processing for batch requests. ECS is better suited than Lambda for loading 1 GB of model data into memory at startup (Lambda has memory limits). Auto scaling based on SQS queue size handles irregular usage patterns efficiently."
