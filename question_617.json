  "question": "A company wants to migrate an on-premises data center to AWS. The data center hosts a storage server that stores data in an NFS-based file system. The storage server holds 200 GB of data. The company needs to migrate the data without interruption to existing services. Multiple resources in AWS must be able to access the data by using the NFS protocol.\n\nWhich combination of steps will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively? (Choose two.)",
  "options": {
    "A": "Create an Amazon FSx for Lustre file system.",
    "B": "Create an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file system.",
    "C": "Create an Amazon S3 bucket to receive the data.",
    "D": "Manually use an operating system copy command to push the data into the AWS destination.",
    "E": "Install an AWS DataSync agent in the on-premises data center. Use a DataSync task between the on-premises location and AWS."
  },
  "correct_answer": ["B", "E"],
  "explanation": "Amazon EFS provides NFS protocol support, allowing multiple AWS resources to access the data. AWS DataSync efficiently migrates data from on-premises NFS storage to EFS with minimal interruption and automatic data integrity verification."
