  "question": "A company needs to design a hybrid network architecture. The company's workloads are currently stored in the AWS Cloud and in on-premises data centers. The workloads require single-digit latencies to communicate. The company uses an AWS Transit Gateway transit gateway to connect multiple VPCs.\n\nWhich combination of steps will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively? (Choose two.)",
  "options": {
    "A": "Establish an AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection to each VPC.",
    "B": "Associate an AWS Direct Connect gateway with the transit gateway that is attached to the VPCs.",
    "C": "Establish an AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection to an AWS Direct Connect gateway.",
    "D": "Establish an AWS Direct Connect connection. Create a transit virtual interface (VIF) to a Direct Connect gateway.",
    "E": "Associate AWS Site-to-Site VPN connections with the transit gateway that is attached to the VPCs."
  },
  "correct_answer": ["B", "D"],
  "explanation": "Direct Connect provides consistent, low-latency connectivity required for single-digit latencies. A transit VIF on Direct Connect gateway connects to Transit Gateway, which then provides access to all attached VPCs cost-effectively through a single connection."
