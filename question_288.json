  "question": "A company is migrating a Linux-based web server group to AWS. The web servers must access files in a shared file store for some content. The company must not make any changes to the application.\n\nWhat should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Create an Amazon S3 Standard bucket with access to the web servers.",
    "B": "Configure an Amazon CloudFront distribution with an Amazon S3 bucket as the origin.",
    "C": "Create an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file system. Mount the EFS file system on all web servers.",
    "D": "Configure a General Purpose SSD (gp3) Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume. Mount the EBS volume to all web servers."
  },
  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": "EFS provides a POSIX-compliant shared file system that can be mounted on multiple Linux EC2 instances simultaneously. No application changes are needed - it appears as a standard file system. S3 requires application changes to use object storage APIs. CloudFront is for content delivery, not shared storage. EBS volumes can only be attached to one instance at a time (except Multi-Attach for io1/io2)."
