  "question": "A company wants to enhance its ecommerce order-processing application that is deployed on AWS. The application must process each order exactly once without affecting the customer experience during unpredictable traffic surges.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Create an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) FIFO queue. Put all the orders in the SQS queue. Configure an AWS Lambda function as the target to process the orders.",
    "B": "Create an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) standard topic. Publish all the orders to the SNS standard topic. Configure the application as a notification target.",
    "C": "Create a flow by using Amazon AppFlow. Send the orders to the flow. Configure an AWS Lambda function as the target to process the orders.",
    "D": "Configure AWS X-Ray in the application to track the order requests. Configure the application to process the orders by pulling the orders from Amazon CloudWatch."
  },
  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": "SQS FIFO queues provide exactly-once processing, which ensures each order is processed only once. The queue also decouples the application to handle traffic surges without affecting customer experience."
