  "question": "A company needs to export its database once a day to Amazon S3 for other teams to access. The exported object size varies between 2 GB and 5 GB. The S3 access pattern for the data is variable and changes rapidly. The data must be immediately available and must remain accessible for up to 3 months. The company needs the most cost-effective solution that will not increase retrieval time.\nWhich S3 storage class should the company use to meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "S3 Intelligent-Tiering",
    "B": "S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval",
    "C": "S3 Standard",
    "D": "S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA)"
  },
  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": "S3 Intelligent-Tiering automatically moves data between access tiers based on changing access patterns without retrieval fees or performance impact. Since access patterns are variable and unpredictable, Intelligent-Tiering optimizes costs automatically while maintaining immediate availability."
