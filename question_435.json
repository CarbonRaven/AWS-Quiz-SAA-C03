  "question": "A company needs to migrate a MySQL database from its on-premises data center to AWS within 2 weeks. The database is 20 TB in size. The company wants to complete the migration with minimal downtime.\n\nWhich solution will migrate the database MOST cost-effectively?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Order an AWS Snowball Edge Storage Optimized device. Use AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) with AWS Schema Conversion Tool (AWS SCT) to migrate the database with replication of ongoing changes. Send the Snowball Edge device to AWS to finish the migration and continue the ongoing replication.",
    "B": "Order an AWS Snowmobile vehicle. Use AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) with AWS Schema Conversion Tool (AWS SCT) to migrate the database with ongoing changes. Send the Snowmobile vehicle back to AWS to finish the migration and continue the ongoing replication.",
    "C": "Order an AWS Snowball Edge Compute Optimized with GPU device. Use AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) with AWS Schema Conversion Tool (AWS SCT) to migrate the database with ongoing changes. Send the Snowball device to AWS to finish the migration and continue the ongoing replication.",
    "D": "Order a 1 GB dedicated AWS Direct Connect connection to establish a connection with the data center. Use AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) with AWS Schema Conversion Tool (AWS SCT) to migrate the database with replication of ongoing changes."
  },
  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": "Snowball Edge Storage Optimized can transfer 20 TB quickly (faster than network for this size). DMS with SCT handles MySQL migration and ongoing replication for minimal downtime. Snowmobile is for exabyte-scale (overkill for 20 TB). Compute Optimized is for edge computing, not bulk data transfer. Direct Connect provisioning takes weeks and costs more for one-time transfer."
