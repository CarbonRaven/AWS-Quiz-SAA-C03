  "question": "A company needs to migrate a legacy application from an on-premises data center to the AWS Cloud because of hardware capacity constraints. The application runs 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The application's database storage continues to grow over time.\n\nWhat should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Migrate the application layer to Amazon EC2 Spot Instances. Migrate the data storage layer to Amazon S3.",
    "B": "Migrate the application layer to Amazon EC2 Reserved Instances. Migrate the data storage layer to Amazon RDS On-Demand Instances.",
    "C": "Migrate the application layer to Amazon EC2 Reserved Instances. Migrate the data storage layer to Amazon Aurora Reserved Instances.",
    "D": "Migrate the application layer to Amazon EC2 On-Demand Instances. Migrate the data storage layer to Amazon RDS Reserved Instances."
  },
  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": "For 24/7 workloads, Reserved Instances provide significant cost savings (up to 72%) over On-Demand. Both EC2 and Aurora Reserved Instances are most cost-effective for continuous operation. Aurora provides auto-scaling storage that grows automatically as data grows. Spot Instances are not suitable for 24/7 critical applications due to interruption risk. On-Demand pricing is more expensive for predictable, continuous workloads."
