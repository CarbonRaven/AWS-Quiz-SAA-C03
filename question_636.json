  "question": "A development team is creating an event-based application that uses AWS Lambda functions. Events will be generated when files are added to an Amazon S3 bucket. The development team currently has Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) configured as the event target from Amazon S3.\n\nWhat should a solutions architect do to process the events from Amazon S3 in a scalable way?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Create an SNS subscription that processes the event in Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) before the event runs in Lambda.",
    "B": "Create an SNS subscription that processes the event in Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) before the event runs in Lambda.",
    "C": "Create an SNS subscription that sends the event to Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS). Configure the SQS queue to trigger a Lambda function.",
    "D": "Create an SNS subscription that sends the event to AWS Server Migration Service (AWS SMS). Configure the Lambda function to poll from the SMS event."
  },
  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": "Using SQS as a buffer between SNS and Lambda provides durability, retry capability, and backpressure handling. Lambda can be triggered by SQS, automatically scaling to process messages while SQS handles traffic spikes by queuing events."
