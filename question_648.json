  "question": "A weather forecasting company needs to process hundreds of gigabytes of data with sub-millisecond latency. The company has a high performance computing (HPC) environment in its data center and wants to expand its forecasting capabilities.\n\nA solutions architect must identify a highly available cloud storage solution that can handle large amounts of sustained throughput. Files that are stored in the solution should be accessible to thousands of compute instances that will simultaneously access and process the entire dataset.\n\nWhat should the solutions architect do to meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Use Amazon FSx for Lustre scratch file systems.",
    "B": "Use Amazon FSx for Lustre persistent file systems.",
    "C": "Use Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) with Bursting Throughput mode.",
    "D": "Use Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) with Provisioned Throughput mode."
  },
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": "FSx for Lustre persistent file systems provide high availability with data replication within an AZ and sub-millisecond latency. Persistent file systems are designed for long-term storage and sustained throughput, unlike scratch file systems which are temporary."
}
