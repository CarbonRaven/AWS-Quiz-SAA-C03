  "question": "A company wants to migrate its MySQL database from on premises to AWS. The company recently experienced a database outage that significantly impacted the business. To ensure this does not happen again, the company wants a reliable database solution on AWS that minimizes data loss and stores every transaction on at least two nodes.\nWhich solution meets these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Create an Amazon RDS DB instance with synchronous replication to three nodes in three Availability Zones.",
    "B": "Create an Amazon RDS MySQL DB instance with Multi-AZ functionality enabled to synchronously replicate the data.",
    "C": "Create an Amazon RDS MySQL DB instance and then create a read replica in a separate AWS Region that synchronously replicates the data.",
    "D": "Create an Amazon EC2 instance with a MySQL engine installed that triggers an AWS Lambda function to synchronously replicate the data to an Amazon RDS MySQL DB instance."
  },
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": "RDS Multi-AZ provides synchronous replication to a standby instance in another AZ, ensuring every transaction is stored on at least two nodes with automatic failover. Read replicas use asynchronous replication. This provides high availability and minimizes data loss."
}
