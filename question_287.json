  "question": "A company wants to migrate a Windows-based application from on premises to the AWS Cloud. The application has three tiers: an application tier, a business tier, and a database tier with Microsoft SQL Server. The company wants to use specific features of SQL Server such as native backups and Data Quality Services. The company also needs to share files for processing between the tiers.\n\nHow should a solutions architect design the architecture to meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Host all three tiers on Amazon EC2 instances. Use Amazon FSx File Gateway for file sharing between the tiers.",
    "B": "Host all three tiers on Amazon EC2 instances. Use Amazon FSx for Windows File Server for file sharing between the tiers.",
    "C": "Host the application tier and the business tier on Amazon EC2 instances. Host the database tier on Amazon RDS. Use Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) for file sharing between the tiers.",
    "D": "Host the application tier and the business tier on Amazon EC2 instances. Host the database tier on Amazon RDS. Use a Provisioned IOPS SSD (io2) Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume for file sharing between the tiers."
  },
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": "SQL Server on EC2 provides access to native backups and Data Quality Services (not available in RDS). FSx for Windows File Server provides native Windows SMB file sharing. FSx File Gateway is for hybrid scenarios. EFS doesn't support Windows. EBS volumes can't be shared across instances. RDS doesn't support all SQL Server native features like Data Quality Services."
