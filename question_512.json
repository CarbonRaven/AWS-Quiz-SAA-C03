  "question": "A company uses AWS Organizations with resources tagged by account. The company also uses AWS Backup to back up its AWS infrastructure resources. The company needs to back up all AWS resources.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Use AWS Config to identify all untagged resources. Tag the identified resources programmatically. Use tags in the backup plan.",
    "B": "Use AWS Config to identify all resources that are not running. Add those resources to the backup vault.",
    "C": "Require all AWS account owners to review their resources to identify the resources that need to be backed up.",
    "D": "Use Amazon Inspector to identify all noncompliant resources."
  },
  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": "AWS Config can identify untagged resources using rules. Once resources are properly tagged, AWS Backup can use tag-based backup policies to automatically back up all resources. This provides automated, consistent backup coverage with minimal operational overhead."
