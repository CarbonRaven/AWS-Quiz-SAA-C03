  "question": "A company is migrating an on-premises application to AWS. The company wants to use Amazon Redshift as a solution.\n\nWhich use cases are suitable for Amazon Redshift in this scenario? (Choose three.)",
  "options": {
    "A": "Supporting data APIs to access data with traditional, containerized, and event-driven applications",
    "B": "Supporting client-side and server-side encryption",
    "C": "Building analytics workloads during specified hours and when the application is not active",
    "D": "Caching data to reduce the pressure on the backend database",
    "E": "Scaling globally to support petabytes of data and tens of millions of requests per minute",
    "F": "Creating a secondary replica of the cluster by using the AWS Management Console"
  },
  "correct_answer": ["B", "C", "E"],
  "explanation": "Redshift supports both client-side and server-side encryption (B). Redshift is ideal for analytics workloads and can be paused when not in use (C). Redshift can scale to petabytes and handle high query volumes (E). Caching is not a Redshift use case. Redshift doesn't create replicas via console in the traditional sense."
