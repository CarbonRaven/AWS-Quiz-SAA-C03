  "question": "A company runs a three-tier application in a VPC. The database tier uses an Amazon RDS for MySQL DB instance.\n\nThe company plans to migrate the RDS for MySQL DB instance to an Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster. The company needs a solution that replicates the data changes that happen during the migration to the new database.\n\nWhich combination of steps will meet these requirements? (Choose two.)",
  "options": {
    "A": "Use AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) Schema Conversion to transform the database objects.",
    "B": "Use AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) Schema Conversion to create an Aurora PostgreSQL read replica on the RDS for MySQL DB instance.",
    "C": "Configure an Aurora MySQL read replica for the RDS for MySQL DB instance.",
    "D": "Define an AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) task with change data capture (CDC) to migrate the data.",
    "E": "Promote the Aurora PostgreSQL read replica to a standalone Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster when the replica lag is zero."
  },
  "correct_answer": ["A", "D"],
  "explanation": "AWS DMS Schema Conversion is needed to transform MySQL database objects to PostgreSQL format (heterogeneous migration). DMS with CDC (Change Data Capture) enables continuous replication of data changes during migration, ensuring the target database stays synchronized with ongoing changes in the source."
