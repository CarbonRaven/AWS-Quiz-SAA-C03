    "C": "Use Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) to distribute the SMS messages. Use AWS Lambda to process the responses.",
    "D": "Create an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) FIFO topic. Subscribe an Amazon Kinesis data stream to the SNS topic for analysis and archiving."
  },
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": "Amazon Pinpoint is designed for marketing communications including SMS with two-way messaging support. Pinpoint can send events to Kinesis for long-term storage and analysis. SQS and SNS don't send SMS messages directly to users."
