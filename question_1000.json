  "question": "A company currently stores 5 TB of data in on-premises block storage systems. The company's current storage solution provides limited space for additional data. The company runs applications on premises that must be able to retrieve frequently accessed data with low latency. The company requires a cloud-based storage solution.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements with the MOST operational efficiency?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Use Amazon S3 File Gateway. Integrate S3 File Gateway with the on-premises applications to store and directly retrieve files by using the SMB file system.",
    "B": "Use an AWS Storage Gateway Volume Gateway with cached volumes as iSCSI targets.",
    "C": "Use an AWS Storage Gateway Volume Gateway with stored volumes as iSCSI targets.",
    "D": "Use an AWS Storage Gateway Tape Gateway. Integrate Tape Gateway with the on-premises applications to store virtual tapes in Amazon S3."
  },
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": "Volume Gateway with cached volumes provides block storage (iSCSI) with frequently accessed data cached locally for low latency access. Primary data is stored in S3, providing virtually unlimited cloud storage while maintaining fast access to hot data on-premises."
