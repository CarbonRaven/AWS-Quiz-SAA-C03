  "question": "A company plans to rehost an application to Amazon EC2 instances that use Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) as the attached storage.\n\nA solutions architect must design a solution to ensure that all newly created Amazon EBS volumes are encrypted by default. The solution must also prevent the creation of unencrypted EBS volumes.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Configure the EC2 account attributes to always encrypt new EBS volumes.",
    "B": "Use AWS Config. Configure the encrypted-volumes identifier. Apply the default AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key.",
    "C": "Configure AWS Systems Manager to create encrypted copies of the EBS volumes. Reconfigure the EC2 instances to use the encrypted volumes.",
    "D": "Create a customer managed key in AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS). Configure AWS Migration Hub to use the key when the company migrates workloads."
  },
  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": "EC2 account attribute 'Always encrypt new EBS volumes' ensures all new EBS volumes are encrypted by default. This is a simple account-level setting that prevents creation of unencrypted volumes."
