  "question": "An Amazon EC2 administrator created the following policy associated with an IAM group containing several users:\n\n{\n  \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n  \"Statement\": [\n    {\n      \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n      \"Action\": \"ec2:TerminateInstances\",\n      \"Resource\": \"*\",\n      \"Condition\": {\n        \"IpAddress\": {\n          \"aws:SourceIp\": \"10.100.100.0/24\"\n        }\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"Effect\": \"Deny\",\n      \"Action\": \"ec2:*\",\n      \"Resource\": \"*\",\n      \"Condition\": {\n        \"StringNotEquals\": {\n          \"ec2:Region\": \"us-east-1\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nWhat is the effect of this policy?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Users can terminate an EC2 instance in any AWS Region except us-east-1.",
    "B": "Users can terminate an EC2 instance with the IP address 10.100.100.1 in the us-east-1 Region.",
    "C": "Users can terminate an EC2 instance in the us-east-1 Region when the user's source IP is 10.100.100.254.",
    "D": "Users cannot terminate an EC2 instance in the us-east-1 Region when the user's source IP is 10.100.100.254."
  },
  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": "The policy allows ec2:TerminateInstances from IP range 10.100.100.0/24, and denies all EC2 actions outside us-east-1. Combined effect: users can terminate instances only in us-east-1 when their source IP is in 10.100.100.0/24."
