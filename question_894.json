  "question": "A company hosts a website on Amazon EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB). The website serves static content. Website traffic is increasing. The company wants to minimize the website hosting costs.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Move the website to an Amazon S3 bucket. Configure an Amazon CloudFront distribution for the S3 bucket.",
    "B": "Move the website to an Amazon S3 bucket. Configure an Amazon ElastiCache cluster for the S3 bucket.",
    "C": "Move the website to AWS Amplify. Configure an ALB to resolve to the Amplify website.",
    "D": "Move the website to AWS Amplify. Configure EC2 instances to cache the website."
  },
  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": "For static content, S3 with CloudFront is the most cost-effective solution. S3 eliminates EC2 and ALB costs, and CloudFront provides global caching and reduced S3 request costs. ElastiCache doesn't cache S3 content."
}
