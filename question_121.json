  "question": "A company is running an online transaction processing (OLTP) workload on AWS. This workload uses an unencrypted Amazon RDS DB instance in a Multi-AZ deployment. Daily database snapshots are taken from this instance.\nWhat should a solutions architect do to ensure the database and snapshots are always encrypted moving forward?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Encrypt a copy of the latest DB snapshot. Replace existing DB instance by restoring the encrypted snapshot.",
    "B": "Create a new encrypted Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume and copy the snapshots to it. Enable encryption on the DB instance.",
    "C": "Copy the snapshots and enable encryption using AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) Restore encrypted snapshot to an existing DB instance.",
    "D": "Copy the snapshots to an Amazon S3 bucket that is encrypted using server-side encryption with AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) managed keys (SSE-KMS)."
  },
  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": "You cannot directly encrypt an unencrypted RDS instance. The correct approach is to create an encrypted copy of the snapshot, then restore a new encrypted DB instance from it. This ensures both the database and future snapshots are encrypted."
