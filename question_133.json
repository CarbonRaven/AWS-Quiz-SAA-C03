  "question": "A company runs an Oracle database on premises. As part of the company's migration to AWS, the company wants to upgrade the database to the most recent available version. The company also wants to set up disaster recovery (DR) for the database. The company needs to minimize the operational overhead for normal operations and DR setup. The company also needs to maintain access to the database's underlying operating system.\nWhich solution will meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Migrate the Oracle database to an Amazon EC2 instance. Set up database replication to a different AWS Region.",
    "B": "Migrate the Oracle database to Amazon RDS for Oracle. Activate Cross-Region automated backups to replicate the snapshots to another AWS Region.",
    "C": "Migrate the Oracle database to Amazon RDS Custom for Oracle. Create a read replica for the database in another AWS Region.",
    "D": "Migrate the Oracle database to Amazon RDS for Oracle. Create a standby database in another Availability Zone."
  },
  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": "RDS Custom for Oracle provides OS-level access while still being a managed service (reduces operational overhead). Cross-Region read replicas provide DR capability. Standard RDS doesn't allow OS access, and EC2 requires more operational overhead."
}
