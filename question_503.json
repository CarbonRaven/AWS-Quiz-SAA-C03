  "question": "A company runs an infrastructure monitoring service. The company is building a new feature that will enable the service to monitor data in customer AWS accounts. The new feature will call AWS APIs in customer accounts to describe Amazon EC2 instances and read Amazon CloudWatch metrics.\n\nWhat should the company do to obtain access to customer accounts in the MOST secure way?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Ensure that the customers create an IAM role in their account with read-only EC2 and CloudWatch permissions and a trust policy to the company's account.",
    "B": "Create a serverless API that implements a token vending machine to provide temporary AWS credentials for a role with read-only EC2 and CloudWatch permissions.",
    "C": "Ensure that the customers create an IAM user in their account with read-only EC2 and CloudWatch permissions. Encrypt and store customer access and secret keys in a secrets management system.",
    "D": "Ensure that the customers create an Amazon Cognito user in their account to use an IAM role with read-only EC2 and CloudWatch permissions. Encrypt and store the Amazon Cognito user and password in a secrets management system."
  },
  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": "Cross-account IAM roles with trust policies are the most secure way to provide access to customer accounts. The company assumes the role to get temporary credentials, eliminating the need to store long-term credentials. IAM users require storing access keys, which is less secure."
