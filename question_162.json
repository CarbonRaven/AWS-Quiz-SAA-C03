  "question": "A company wants to use high performance computing (HPC) infrastructure on AWS for financial risk modeling. The company's HPC workloads run on Linux. Each HPC workflow runs on hundreds of Amazon EC2 Spot Instances, is short-lived, and generates thousands of output files that are ultimately stored in persistent storage for analytics and long-term future use.\nThe company seeks a cloud storage solution that permits the copying of on-premises data to long-term persistent storage to make data available for processing by all EC2 instances. The solution should also be a high performance file system that is integrated with persistent storage to read and write datasets and output files.\nWhich combination of AWS services meets these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Amazon FSx for Lustre integrated with Amazon S3",
    "B": "Amazon FSx for Windows File Server integrated with Amazon S3",
    "C": "Amazon S3 Glacier integrated with Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS)",
    "D": "Amazon S3 bucket with a VPC endpoint integrated with an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) General Purpose SSD (gp2) volume"
  },
  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": "FSx for Lustre is a high-performance file system designed for HPC workloads on Linux. It integrates natively with S3 for persistent storage - data can be loaded from S3 and results written back to S3 automatically. This provides both high IOPS for processing and durable long-term storage."
