  "question": "A company has an on-premises data center that is running out of storage capacity. The company wants to migrate its storage infrastructure to AWS while minimizing bandwidth costs. The solution must allow for immediate retrieval of data at no additional cost.\n\nHow can these requirements be met?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Deploy Amazon S3 Glacier Vault and enable expedited retrieval. Enable provisioned retrieval capacity for the workload.",
    "B": "Deploy AWS Storage Gateway using cached volumes. Use Storage Gateway to store data in Amazon S3 while retaining copies of frequently accessed data subsets locally.",
    "C": "Deploy AWS Storage Gateway using stored volumes to store data locally. Use Storage Gateway to asynchronously back up point-in-time snapshots of the data to Amazon S3.",
    "D": "Deploy AWS Direct Connect to connect with the on-premises data center. Configure AWS Storage Gateway to store data locally. Use Storage Gateway to asynchronously back up point-in-time snapshots of the data to Amazon S3."
  },
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": "Storage Gateway cached volumes store primary data in S3 while caching frequently accessed data locally. This allows immediate retrieval of cached data at no additional cost, while the full dataset is stored in S3, addressing storage capacity issues."
}
