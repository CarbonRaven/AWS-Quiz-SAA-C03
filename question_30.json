  "question": "A development team runs monthly resource-intensive tests on its general purpose Amazon RDS for MySQL DB instance with Performance Insights enabled. The testing lasts for 48 hours once a month and is the only process that uses the database. The team wants to reduce the cost of running the tests without reducing the compute and memory attributes of the DB instance.\nWhich solution meets these requirements MOST cost-effectively?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Stop the DB instance when tests are completed. Restart the DB instance when required.",
    "B": "Use an Auto Scaling policy with the DB instance to automatically scale when tests are completed.",
    "C": "Create a snapshot when tests are completed. Terminate the DB instance and restore the snapshot when required.",
    "D": "Modify the DB instance to a low-capacity instance when tests are completed. Modify the DB instance again when required."
  },
  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": "Since the DB is only used 48 hours per month, creating a snapshot and terminating the instance eliminates costs for the remaining ~700 hours. Stopping an RDS instance only works for 7 days before it auto-restarts, making snapshots more cost-effective for monthly usage."
