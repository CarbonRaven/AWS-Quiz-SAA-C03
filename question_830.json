  "question": "A company has 5 TB of datasets. The datasets consist of 1 million user profiles and 10 million connections. The user profiles have connections as many-to-many relationships. The company needs a performance efficient way to find mutual connections up to five levels.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Use an Amazon S3 bucket to store the datasets. Use Amazon Athena to perform SQL JOIN queries to find connections.",
    "B": "Use Amazon Neptune to store the datasets with edges and vertices. Query the data to find connections.",
    "C": "Use an Amazon S3 bucket to store the datasets. Use Amazon QuickSight to visualize connections.",
    "D": "Use Amazon RDS to store the datasets with multiple tables. Perform SQL JOIN queries to find connections."
  },
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": "Amazon Neptune is a graph database optimized for storing and querying highly connected data. Finding mutual connections through multiple levels (graph traversal) is Neptune's core strength, far more efficient than SQL JOINs."
}
