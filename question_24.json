  "question": "A company observes an increase in Amazon EC2 costs in its most recent bill. The billing team notices unwanted vertical scaling of instance types for a couple of EC2 instances. A solutions architect needs to create a graph comparing the last 2 months of EC2 costs and perform an in-depth analysis to identify the root cause of the vertical scaling.\nHow should the solutions architect generate the information with the LEAST operational overhead?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Use AWS Budgets to create a budget report and compare EC2 costs based on instance types.",
    "B": "Use Cost Explorer's granular filtering feature to perform an in-depth analysis of EC2 costs based on instance types.",
    "C": "Use graphs from the AWS Billing and Cost Management dashboard to compare EC2 costs based on instance types for the last 2 months.",
    "D": "Use AWS Cost and Usage Reports to create a report and send it to an Amazon S3 bucket. Use Amazon QuickSight with Amazon S3 as a source to generate an interactive graph based on instance types."

  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": "AWS Cost Explorer provides built-in granular filtering and graphing capabilities to analyze costs by instance type, service, and time period with minimal operational overhead - no additional setup required."
