  "question": "An ecommerce company runs a PostgreSQL database on premises. The database stores data by using high IOPS Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) block storage. The daily peak I/O transactions per second do not exceed 15,000 IOPS. The company wants to migrate the database to Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL and provision disk IOPS performance independent of disk storage capacity.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Configure the General Purpose SSD (gp2) EBS volume storage type and provision 15,000 IOPS.",
    "B": "Configure the Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1) EBS volume storage type and provision 15,000 IOPS.",
    "C": "Configure the General Purpose SSD (gp3) EBS volume storage type and provision 15,000 IOPS.",
    "D": "Configure the EBS magnetic volume type to achieve maximum IOPS."
  },
  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": "GP3 volumes allow provisioning IOPS independently of storage capacity and are more cost-effective than io1 for up to 16,000 IOPS. GP2 ties IOPS to storage size (3 IOPS/GB), which would require 5TB storage for 15,000 IOPS. GP3 is the most cost-effective option."
