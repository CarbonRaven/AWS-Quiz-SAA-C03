  "question": "A company has a data ingestion workflow that consists of the following:\n- An Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic for notifications about new data deliveries\n- An AWS Lambda function to process the data and record metadata\nThe company observes that the ingestion workflow fails occasionally because of network connectivity issues. When such a failure occurs, the Lambda function does not ingest the corresponding data unless the company manually reruns the job.\nWhich combination of actions should a solutions architect take to ensure that the Lambda function ingests all data in the future? (Choose two.)",
  "options": {
    "A": "Deploy the Lambda function in multiple Availability Zones.",
    "B": "Create an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue, and subscribe it to the SNS topic.",
    "C": "Increase the CPU and memory that are allocated to the Lambda function.",
    "D": "Increase provisioned throughput for the Lambda function.",
    "E": "Modify the Lambda function to read from an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue."
  },
  "correct_answer": ["B", "E"],
  "explanation": "Adding SQS between SNS and Lambda provides message persistence. If Lambda fails, messages remain in the queue for retry. Lambda reading from SQS enables automatic retries with built-in dead-letter queue support."
