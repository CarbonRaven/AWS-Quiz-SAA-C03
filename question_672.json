    "B": "Configure an AWS Glue crawler to crawl the data. Configure Amazon Athena to query the data.",
    "C": "Create external tables in a Hive metastore. Configure Spark jobs in Amazon EMR to query the data.",
    "D": "Configure an AWS Glue crawler to crawl the data. Configure Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics to use SQL to query the data."
  },
