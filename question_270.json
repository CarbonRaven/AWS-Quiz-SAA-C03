  "question": "A company is using a centralized AWS account to store log data in various Amazon S3 buckets. A solutions architect needs to ensure that the data is encrypted at rest before the data is uploaded to the S3 buckets. The data also must be encrypted in transit.\n\nWhich solution meets these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Use client-side encryption to encrypt the data that is being uploaded to the S3 buckets.",
    "B": "Use server-side encryption to encrypt the data that is being uploaded to the S3 buckets.",
    "C": "Create bucket policies that require the use of server-side encryption with S3 managed encryption keys (SSE-S3) for S3 uploads.",
    "D": "Enable the security option to encrypt the S3 buckets through the use of a default AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key."
  },
  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": "Client-side encryption encrypts data BEFORE upload, ensuring data is encrypted at rest before reaching S3. HTTPS provides encryption in transit. Server-side encryption (B, C, D) encrypts data AFTER it arrives at S3, not before upload. The requirement specifically states data must be encrypted 'before the data is uploaded' - only client-side encryption meets this."
