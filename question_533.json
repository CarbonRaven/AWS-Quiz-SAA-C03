  "question": "A company stores data in Amazon S3. According to regulations, the data must not contain personally identifiable information (PII). The company recently discovered that S3 buckets have some objects that contain PII. The company needs to automatically detect PII in S3 buckets and to notify the company's security team.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Use Amazon Macie. Create an Amazon EventBridge rule to filter the SensitiveData event type from Macie findings and to send an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) notification to the security team.",
    "B": "Use Amazon GuardDuty. Create an Amazon EventBridge rule to filter the CRITICAL event type from GuardDuty findings and to send an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) notification to the security team.",
    "C": "Use Amazon Macie. Create an Amazon EventBridge rule to filter the SensitiveData:S3Object/Personal event type from Macie findings and to send an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) notification to the security team.",
    "D": "Use Amazon GuardDuty. Create an Amazon EventBridge rule to filter the CRITICAL event type from GuardDuty findings and to send an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) notification to the security team."
  },
  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": "Amazon Macie is specifically designed to discover and protect sensitive data like PII in S3. EventBridge rules can filter Macie findings and send SNS notifications to the security team. GuardDuty is for threat detection, not data classification. SNS is more appropriate than SQS for notifications."
