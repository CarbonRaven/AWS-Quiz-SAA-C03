  "question": "A company wants to migrate its web applications from on premises to AWS. The company is located close to the eu-central-1 Region. Because of regulations, the company cannot launch some of its applications in eu-central-1. The company wants to achieve single-digit millisecond latency.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Deploy the applications in eu-central-1. Extend the company's VPC from eu-central-1 to an edge location in Amazon CloudFront.",
    "B": "Deploy the applications in AWS Local Zones by extending the company's VPC from eu-central-1 to the chosen Local Zone.",
    "C": "Deploy the applications in eu-central-1. Extend the company's VPC from eu-central-1 to the regional edge caches in Amazon CloudFront.",
    "D": "Deploy the applications in AWS Wavelength Zones by extending the company's VPC from eu-central-1 to the chosen Wavelength Zone."
  },
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": "AWS Local Zones extend AWS infrastructure closer to end users for single-digit millisecond latency while keeping regulatory compliance (applications run outside the main region). Local Zones are extensions of the parent region's VPC. Wavelength is for 5G mobile edge computing."
