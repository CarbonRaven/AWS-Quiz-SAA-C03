  "options": {
    "A": "Ensure the root user uses a strong password.",
    "B": "Enable multi-factor authentication to the root user.",
    "C": "Store root user access keys in an encrypted Amazon S3 bucket.",

    "E": "Apply the required permissions to the root user with an inline policy document."
  },
  "correct_answer": ["A", "B"],
  "explanation": "AWS security best practices: use a strong, unique password for root (A) and enable MFA for root user (B). Root users shouldn't have access keys. Root users can't be added to groups. IAM policies don't apply to root users who have full access by default."
