  "question": "A company previously migrated its data warehouse solution to AWS. The company also has an AWS Direct Connect connection. Corporate office users query the data warehouse using a visualization tool. The average size of a query returned by the data warehouse is 50 MB and each webpage sent by the visualization tool is approximately 500 KB. Result sets returned by the data warehouse are not cached.\nWhich solution provides the LOWEST data transfer egress cost for the company?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Host the visualization tool on premises and query the data warehouse directly over the internet.",
    "B": "Host the visualization tool in the same AWS Region as the data warehouse. Access it over the internet.",
    "C": "Host the visualization tool on premises and query the data warehouse directly over a Direct Connect connection at a location in the same AWS Region.",
    "D": "Host the visualization tool in the same AWS Region as the data warehouse and access it over a Direct Connect connection at a location in the same Region."
  },
  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": "Hosting the visualization tool in AWS keeps the 50 MB query results within AWS (no egress). Only 500 KB webpages transfer over Direct Connect to users. Direct Connect has lower data transfer costs than internet. This minimizes egress by processing data in AWS and sending only rendered output."
