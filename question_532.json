  "question": "A company has a workload in an AWS Region. Customers connect to and access the workload by using an Amazon API Gateway REST API. The company uses Amazon Route 53 as its DNS provider. The company wants to provide individual and secure URLs for all customers.\n\nWhich combination of steps will meet these requirements with the MOST operational efficiency? (Choose three.)",
  "options": {
    "A": "Register the required domain in a registrar. Create a wildcard custom domain name in a Route 53 hosted zone and record in the zone that points to the API Gateway endpoint.",
    "B": "Request a wildcard certificate that matches the domains in AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) in a different Region.",
    "C": "Create hosted zones for each customer as required in Route 53. Create zone records that point to the API Gateway endpoint.",
    "D": "Request a wildcard certificate that matches the custom domain name in AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) in the same Region.",
    "E": "Create multiple API endpoints for each customer in API Gateway.",
    "F": "Create a custom domain name in API Gateway for the REST API. Import the certificate from AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)."
  },
  "correct_answer": ["A", "D", "F"],
  "explanation": "A wildcard domain in Route 53 allows individual customer URLs (A). ACM certificate must be in the same Region as API Gateway for REST APIs (D). Custom domain name in API Gateway with the ACM certificate enables secure HTTPS (F). Creating separate hosted zones or APIs per customer adds unnecessary complexity."
