  "question": "A company needs to retain application log files for a critical application for 10 years. The application team regularly accesses logs from the past month for troubleshooting but logs older than 1 month are rarely accessed. The application generates more than 10 TB of logs per month.\n\nWhich storage option meets these requirements MOST cost-effectively?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Store the logs in Amazon S3. Use AWS Backup to move logs more than 1 month old to S3 Glacier Deep Archive.",
    "B": "Store the logs in Amazon S3. Use S3 Lifecycle policies to move logs more than 1 month old to S3 Glacier Deep Archive.",
    "C": "Store the logs in Amazon CloudWatch Logs. Use AWS Backup to move logs more than 1 month old to S3 Glacier Deep Archive.",
    "D": "Store the logs in Amazon CloudWatch Logs. Use Amazon S3 Lifecycle policies to move logs more than 1 month old to S3 Glacier Deep Archive."
  },
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": "S3 with Lifecycle policies to transition to Glacier Deep Archive after 1 month is the most cost-effective solution for long-term log retention. S3 handles the 10 TB/month volume efficiently. Deep Archive is the cheapest storage for rarely accessed data. CloudWatch Logs is more expensive at this scale. AWS Backup doesn't transition S3 objects to Glacier tiers."
