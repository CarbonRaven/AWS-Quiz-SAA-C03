  "question": "A company is migrating from a monolithic architecture for a web application that is hosted on Amazon EC2 to a serverless microservices architecture. The company wants to use AWS services that support an event-driven, loosely coupled architecture. The company wants to use the publish/subscribe (pub/sub) pattern.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Configure an Amazon API Gateway REST API to invoke an AWS Lambda function that publishes events to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Configure one or more subscribers to read events from the SQS queue.",
    "B": "Configure an Amazon API Gateway REST API to invoke an AWS Lambda function that publishes events to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic. Configure one or more subscribers to receive events from the SNS topic.",
    "C": "Configure an Amazon API Gateway WebSocket API to write to a data stream in Amazon Kinesis Data Streams with enhanced fan-out. Configure one or more subscribers to receive events from the data stream.",
    "D": "Configure an Amazon API Gateway HTTP API to invoke an AWS Lambda function that publishes events to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic. Configure one or more subscribers to receive events from the topic."
  },
  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": "API Gateway HTTP APIs are more cost-effective than REST APIs for simple use cases. SNS provides native pub/sub pattern support. This combination delivers the most cost-effective serverless pub/sub solution."
