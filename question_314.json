  "question": "A company has an on-premises MySQL database used by the global sales team with infrequent access patterns. The sales team requires the database to have minimal downtime. A database administrator wants to migrate this database to AWS without selecting a particular instance type in anticipation of more users in the future.\n\nWhich service should a solutions architect recommend?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Amazon Aurora MySQL",
    "B": "Amazon Aurora Serverless for MySQL",
    "C": "Amazon Redshift Spectrum",
    "D": "Amazon RDS for MySQL"
  },
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": "Aurora Serverless automatically scales capacity based on demand without selecting instance types. It's ideal for infrequent, variable workloads. Standard Aurora and RDS require selecting instance types. Redshift Spectrum is for analytics on S3 data, not transactional databases."
