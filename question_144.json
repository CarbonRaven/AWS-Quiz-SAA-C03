  "question": "A company recently started using Amazon Aurora as the data store for its global ecommerce application. When large reports are run, developers report that the ecommerce application is performing poorly. After reviewing metrics in Amazon CloudWatch, a solutions architect finds that the ReadIOPS and CPUUtilization metrics are spiking when monthly reports run.\nWhat is the MOST cost-effective solution?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Migrate the monthly reporting to Amazon Redshift.",
    "B": "Migrate the monthly reporting to an Aurora Replica.",
    "C": "Migrate the Aurora database to a larger instance class.",
    "D": "Increase the Provisioned IOPS on the Aurora instance."
  },
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": "Aurora Replicas offload read traffic from the primary instance. Running reports against a replica prevents impact on the production application. This is more cost-effective than migrating to Redshift or upgrading the primary instance, as replicas share the same storage."
}
