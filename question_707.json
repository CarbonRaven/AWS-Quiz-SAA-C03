  "question": "A company is using an Application Load Balancer (ALB) to present its application to the internet. The company finds abnormal traffic access patterns across the application. A solutions architect needs to improve visibility into the infrastructure to help the company understand these abnormalities better.\n\nWhat is the MOST operationally efficient solution that meets these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Create a table in Amazon Athena for AWS CloudTrail logs. Create a query for the relevant information.",
    "B": "Enable ALB access logging to Amazon S3. Create a table in Amazon Athena, and query the logs.",
    "C": "Enable ALB access logging to Amazon S3. Open each file in a text editor, and search each line for the relevant information.",
    "D": "Use Amazon EMR on a dedicated Amazon EC2 instance to directly query the ALB to acquire traffic access log information."
  },
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": "ALB access logs provide detailed information about requests sent to the load balancer. Storing logs in S3 and using Athena to query them is the most operationally efficient approach. Athena is serverless and allows SQL queries on S3 data without manual file inspection."
}
