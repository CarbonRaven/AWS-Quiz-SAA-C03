  "question_text": "A solutions architect must secure a VPC network that hosts Amazon EC2 instances. The EC2 instances contain highly sensitive data and run in a private subnet. According to company policy, the EC2 instances that run in the VPC can access only approved third-party software repositories on the internet for software product updates that use the third party\u2019s URL. Other internet traffic must be blocked.\n\nWhich solution meets these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Update the route table for the private subnet to route the outbound traffic to an AWS Network Firewall firewall. Configure domain list rule groups.",
    "B": "Use a URL-based rule listener in the ALB\u2019s target group for outbound access to the internet.",
    "C": "Implement strict inbound security group rules. Configure an outbound rule that allows traffic only to the authorized software repositories on the internet by specifying the URLs.",
    "D": "Configure an Application Load Balancer (ALB) in front of the EC2 instances. Direct all outbound traffic to the AL"
