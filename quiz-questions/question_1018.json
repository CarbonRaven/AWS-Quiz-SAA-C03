  "question_text": "A company needs to give a globally distributed development team secure access to the company's AWS resources in a way that complies with security policies. The company currently uses an on-premises Active Directory for internal authentication. The company uses AWS Organizations to manage multiple AWS accounts that support multiple projects. The company needs a solution to integrate with the existing infrastructure to provide centralized identity management and access control. Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?",
