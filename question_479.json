  "question": "A company is making a prototype of the infrastructure for its new website by manually provisioning the necessary infrastructure. This infrastructure includes an Auto Scaling group, an Application Load Balancer and an Amazon RDS database. After the configuration has been thoroughly validated, the company wants the capability to immediately deploy the infrastructure for development and production use in two Availability Zones in an automated fashion.\n\nWhat should a solutions architect recommend to meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Use AWS Systems Manager to replicate and provision the prototype infrastructure in two Availability Zones",
    "B": "Define the infrastructure as a template by using the prototype infrastructure as a guide. Deploy the infrastructure with AWS CloudFormation.",
    "C": "Use AWS Config to record the inventory of resources that are used in the prototype infrastructure. Use AWS Config to deploy the prototype infrastructure into two Availability Zones.",
    "D": "Use AWS Elastic Beanstalk and configure it to use an automated reference to the prototype infrastructure to automatically deploy new environments in two Availability Zones."
  },
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": "AWS CloudFormation is the standard Infrastructure as Code service for defining and deploying AWS resources in an automated, repeatable manner. It allows creating templates based on existing infrastructure that can be deployed to multiple environments."
