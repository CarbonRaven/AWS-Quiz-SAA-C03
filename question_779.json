  "question": "A company has an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file system that contains a reference dataset. The company has applications on Amazon EC2 instances that need to read the dataset. However, the applications must not be able to change the dataset. The company wants to use IAM access control to prevent the applications from being able to modify or delete the dataset.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Mount the EFS file system in read-only mode from within the EC2 instances.",
    "B": "Create a resource policy for the EFS file system that denies the elasticfilesystem:ClientWrite action to the IAM roles that are attached to the EC2 instances.",
    "C": "Create an identity policy for the EFS file system that denies the elasticfilesystem:ClientWrite action on the EFS file system.",
    "D": "Create an EFS access point for each application. Use Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) file permissions to allow read-only access to files in the root directory."
  },
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": "EFS supports resource-based policies (file system policies) that can deny specific IAM actions. Denying elasticfilesystem:ClientWrite on the file system policy for the EC2 instance roles enforces read-only access at the IAM level. This is more secure than relying on mount options which could be changed."
