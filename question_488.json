  "question": "A 4-year-old media company is using the AWS Organizations all features feature set to organize its AWS accounts. According to the company's finance team, the billing information on the member accounts must not be accessible to anyone, including the root user of the member accounts.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Add all finance team users to an IAM group. Attach an AWS managed policy named Billing to the group.",
    "B": "Attach an identity-based policy to deny access to the billing information to all users, including the root user.",
    "C": "Create a service control policy (SCP) to deny access to the billing information. Attach the SCP to the root organizational unit (OU).",
    "D": "Convert from the Organizations all features feature set to the Organizations consolidated billing feature set."
  },
  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": "Service Control Policies (SCPs) can restrict actions for member accounts, including root users. Attaching an SCP that denies billing access to the root OU applies to all member accounts. Identity-based policies cannot restrict root users. Converting to consolidated billing only removes SCP capabilities."
