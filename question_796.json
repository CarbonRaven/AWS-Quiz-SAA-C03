  "question": "A company needs a solution to prevent photos with unwanted content from being uploaded to the company's web application. The solution must not involve training a machine learning (ML) model.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Create and deploy a model by using Amazon SageMaker Autopilot. Create a real-time endpoint that the web application invokes when new photos are uploaded.",
    "B": "Create an AWS Lambda function that uses Amazon Rekognition to detect unwanted content. Create a Lambda function URL that the web application invokes when new photos are uploaded.",
    "C": "Create an Amazon CloudFront function that uses Amazon Comprehend to detect unwanted content. Associate the function with the web application.",
    "D": "Create an AWS Lambda function that uses Amazon Rekognition Video to detect unwanted content. Create a Lambda function URL that the web application invokes when new photos are uploaded."
  },
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": "Amazon Rekognition is a pre-trained ML service that can detect inappropriate, unwanted, or offensive content in images without requiring custom model training. Lambda with a function URL provides a simple integration point for the web application. Rekognition Video is for video analysis, not photos."
