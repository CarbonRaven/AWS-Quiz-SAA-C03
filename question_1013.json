The company wants to cost-optimize the production environment.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Purchase Scheduled Reserved Instances for the EC2 instances that run for only 12 hours on Sunday. Purchase Standard Reserved Instances for the EC2 instances that run constantly between Monday and Saturday.",
    "B": "Purchase Convertible Reserved Instances for the EC2 instances that run for only 12 hours on Sunday. Purchase Standard Reserved Instances for the EC2 instances that run constantly between Monday and Saturday.",
    "C": "Use Spot Instances for the EC2 instances that run for only 12 hours on Sunday. Purchase Standard Reserved Instances for the EC2 instances that run constantly between Monday and Saturday.",
    "D": "Use Spot Instances for the EC2 instances that run for only 12 hours on Sunday. Purchase Convertible Reserved Instances for the EC2 instances that run constantly between Monday and Saturday."
  },
  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": "Scheduled Reserved Instances are designed for workloads that run on a predictable schedule (like 12 hours on Sundays). Standard Reserved Instances provide the best discount for consistently running workloads (Monday-Saturday). Spot Instances cannot be used since the workload cannot tolerate interruptions."
