  "question": "A solutions architect must create a disaster recovery (DR) plan for a high-volume software as a service (SaaS) platform. All data for the platform is stored in an Amazon Aurora MySQL DB cluster.\n\nThe DR plan must replicate data to a secondary AWS Region.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Use MySQL binary log replication to an Aurora cluster in the secondary Region. Provision one DB instance for the Aurora cluster in the secondary Region.",
    "B": "Set up an Aurora global database for the DB cluster. When setup is complete, remove the DB instance from the secondary Region.",
    "C": "Use AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) to continuously replicate data to an Aurora cluster in the secondary Region. Remove the DB instance from the secondary Region.",
    "D": "Set up an Aurora global database for the DB cluster. Specify a minimum of one DB instance in the secondary Region."
  },
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": "Aurora global database provides cross-region replication with sub-second RPO. Removing the DB instance from the secondary region while keeping the storage volume reduces costs - you only pay for storage, not compute. When DR is needed, you add instances. Option D maintains running instances, increasing costs. DMS adds operational complexity."
