  "question": "A company runs a stateless web application in production on a group of Amazon EC2 On-Demand Instances behind an Application Load Balancer. The application experiences heavy usage during an 8-hour period each business day. Application usage is moderate and steady overnight. Application usage is low during weekends.\n\nThe company wants to minimize its EC2 costs without affecting the availability of the application.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Use Spot Instances for the entire workload.",
    "B": "Use Reserved Instances for the baseline level of usage. Use Spot Instances for any additional capacity that the application needs.",
    "C": "Use On-Demand Instances for the baseline level of usage. Use Spot Instances for any additional capacity that the application needs.",
    "D": "Use Dedicated Instances for the baseline level of usage. Use On-Demand Instances for any additional capacity that the application needs."
  },
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": "Reserved Instances for baseline usage (overnight/weekend steady traffic) provide significant savings. Spot Instances for additional capacity during peak hours are cost-effective for stateless applications that can handle interruptions. On-Demand for baseline is more expensive than Reserved. Dedicated Instances are the most expensive option."
