  "question": "A company plans to migrate to AWS and use Amazon EC2 On-Demand Instances for its application. During the migration testing phase, a technical team observes that the application takes a long time to launch and load memory to become fully productive.\n\nWhich solution will reduce the launch time of the application during the next testing phase?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Launch two or more EC2 On-Demand Instances. Turn on auto scaling features and make the EC2 On-Demand Instances available during the next testing phase.",
    "B": "Launch EC2 Spot Instances to support the application and to scale the application so it is available during the next testing phase.",
    "C": "Launch the EC2 On-Demand Instances with hibernation turned on. Configure EC2 Auto Scaling warm pools during the next testing phase.",
    "D": "Launch EC2 On-Demand Instances with Capacity Reservations. Start additional EC2 instances during the next testing phase."
  },
  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": "Hibernation preserves the in-memory state of instances, allowing fast resume. Warm pools maintain pre-initialized instances that can be quickly brought into service. This combination significantly reduces application launch time."
}
