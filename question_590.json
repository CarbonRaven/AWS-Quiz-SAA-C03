  "question": "A company migrated a MySQL database from the company's on-premises data center to an Amazon RDS for MySQL DB instance. The company sized the RDS DB instance to meet the company's average daily workload. Once a month, the database performs slowly when the company runs queries for a report. The company wants to have the ability to run reports and maintain the performance of the daily workloads.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Create a read replica of the database. Direct the queries to the read replica.",
    "B": "Create a backup of the database. Restore the backup to another DB instance. Direct the queries to the new database.",
    "C": "Export the data to Amazon S3. Use Amazon Athena to query the S3 bucket.",
    "D": "Resize the DB instance to accommodate the additional workload."
  },
  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": "Read replicas offload read queries from the primary database, allowing reporting workloads to run without impacting daily operations. This is the most efficient solution for separating reporting queries from transactional workloads."
}
