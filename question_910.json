  "question": "A company hosts its multi-tier, public web application in the AWS Cloud. The web application runs on Amazon EC2 instances, and its database runs on Amazon RDS. The company is anticipating a large increase in sales during an upcoming holiday weekend. A solutions architect needs to build a solution to analyze the performance of the web application with a granularity of no more than 2 minutes.\n\nWhat should the solutions architect do to meet this requirement?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Send Amazon CloudWatch logs to Amazon Redshift. Use Amazon QuickSight to perform further analysis.",
    "B": "Enable detailed monitoring on all EC2 instances. Use Amazon CloudWatch metrics to perform further analysis.",
    "C": "Create an AWS Lambda function to fetch EC2 logs from Amazon CloudWatch Logs. Use Amazon CloudWatch metrics to perform further analysis.",
    "D": "Send EC2 logs to Amazon S3. Use Amazon Redshift to fetch logs from the S3 bucket to process raw data for further analysis with Amazon QuickSight."
  },
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": "Detailed monitoring for EC2 provides metrics at 1-minute intervals (vs 5-minute for basic monitoring), meeting the 2-minute granularity requirement. CloudWatch metrics provide native performance analysis."
}
