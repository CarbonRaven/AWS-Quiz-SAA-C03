  "question": "A consumer survey company has gathered data for several years from a specific geographic region. The company stores this data in an Amazon S3 bucket in an AWS Region.\n\nThe company has started to share this data with a marketing firm in a new geographic region. The company has granted the firm's AWS account access to the S3 bucket. The company wants to minimize the data transfer costs when the marketing firm requests data from the S3 bucket.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Configure the Requester Pays feature on the company's S3 bucket.",
    "B": "Configure S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR) from the company's S3 bucket to one of the marketing firm's S3 buckets.",
    "C": "Configure AWS Resource Access Manager to share the S3 bucket with the marketing firm AWS account.",
    "D": "Configure the company's S3 bucket to use S3 Intelligent-Tiering Sync the S3 bucket to one of the marketing firm's S3 buckets."
  },
  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": "Requester Pays shifts the data transfer costs to the requester (marketing firm) rather than the bucket owner. This minimizes costs for the company while allowing the marketing firm to access the data and pay for their own data transfer."
}
