  "question": "A company wants to create an application to store employee data in a hierarchical structured relationship. The company needs a minimum-latency response to high-traffic queries for the employee data and must protect any sensitive data. The company also needs to receive monthly email messages if any financial information is present in the employee data.\n\nWhich combination of steps should a solutions architect take to meet these requirements? (Choose two.)",
  "options": {
    "A": "Use Amazon Redshift to store the employee data in hierarchies. Unload the data to Amazon S3 every month.",
    "B": "Use Amazon DynamoDB to store the employee data in hierarchies. Export the data to Amazon S3 every month.",
    "C": "Configure Amazon Macie for the AWS account. Integrate Macie with Amazon EventBridge to send monthly events to AWS Lambda.",
    "D": "Use Amazon Athena to analyze the employee data in Amazon S3. Integrate Athena with Amazon QuickSight to publish analysis dashboards and share the dashboards with users.",
    "E": "Configure Amazon Macie for the AWS account. Integrate Macie with Amazon EventBridge to send monthly notifications through an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) subscription."
  },
  "correct_answer": ["B", "E"],
  "explanation": "DynamoDB (B) provides low-latency responses and supports hierarchical data structures. Monthly export to S3 enables Macie scanning. Amazon Macie with SNS (E) detects sensitive financial data and sends email notifications via SNS subscription. Redshift is for analytics, not low-latency queries. Lambda isn't needed for email notifications when SNS can send emails directly."
