The company's CFO is concerned about cloud spending accountability for each department. The CFO wants to receive notification when the spending threshold reaches 60% of the budget.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Use cost allocation tags on AWS resources to label owners. Create usage budgets in AWS Budgets. Add an alert threshold to receive notification when spending exceeds 60% of the budget.",
    "B": "Use AWS Cost Explorer forecasts to determine resource owners. Use AWS Cost Anomaly Detection to create alert threshold notifications when spending exceeds 60% of the budget.",
    "C": "Use cost allocation tags on AWS resources to label owners. Use AWS Support API on AWS Trusted Advisor to create alert threshold notifications when spending exceeds 60% of the budget.",
    "D": "Use AWS Cost Explorer forecasts to determine resource owners. Create usage budgets in AWS Budgets. Add an alert threshold to receive notification when spending exceeds 60% of the budget."
  },
