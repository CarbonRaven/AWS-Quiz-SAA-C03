  "question": "A company wants to standardize its Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume encryption strategy. The company also wants to minimize the cost and configuration effort required to operate the volume encryption check.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Write API calls to describe the EBS volumes and to confirm the EBS volumes are encrypted. Use Amazon EventBridge to schedule an AWS Lambda function to run the API calls.",
    "B": "Write API calls to describe the EBS volumes and to confirm the EBS volumes are encrypted. Run the API calls on an AWS Fargate task.",
    "C": "Create an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy that requires the use of tags on EBS volumes. Use AWS Cost Explorer to display resources that are not properly tagged. Encrypt the untagged resources manually.",
    "D": "Create an AWS Config rule for Amazon EBS to evaluate if a volume is encrypted and to flag the volume if it is not encrypted."
  },
  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": "AWS Config provides managed rules specifically for checking EBS volume encryption (encrypted-volumes rule). It continuously monitors and flags non-compliant volumes with minimal configuration effort and no custom code required, making it the most cost-effective solution."
