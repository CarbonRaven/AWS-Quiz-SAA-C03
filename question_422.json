  "question": "A company is developing a new machine learning (ML) model solution on AWS. The models are developed as independent microservices that fetch approximately 1 GB of model data from Amazon S3 at startup and load the data into memory. Users access the models through an asynchronous API. Users can send a request or a batch of requests and specify where the results should be sent.\n\nThe company provides models to hundreds of users. The usage patterns for the models are irregular. Some models could be unused for days or weeks. Other models could receive batches of thousands of requests at a time.\n\nWhich design should a solutions architect recommend to meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Direct the requests from the API to a Network Load Balancer (NLB). Deploy the models as AWS Lambda functions that are invoked by the NLB.",
    "B": "Direct the requests from the API to an Application Load Balancer (ALB). Deploy the models as Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) services that read from an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Use AWS App Mesh to scale the instances of the ECS cluster based on the SQS queue size.",
    "C": "Direct the requests from the API into an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Deploy the models as AWS Lambda functions that are invoked by SQS events. Use AWS Auto Scaling to increase the number of vCPUs for the Lambda functions based on the SQS queue size.",
    "D": "Direct the requests from the API into an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Deploy the models as Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) services that read from the queue. Enable AWS Auto Scaling on Amazon ECS for both the cluster and copies of the service based on the queue size."
  },
  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": "ECS with SQS handles asynchronous batch processing with scale-to-zero capability. Models loading 1 GB data are better suited for containers than Lambda (memory limits). SQS provides buffering for irregular traffic patterns. Auto Scaling based on queue depth handles burst requests. Lambda can't increase vCPUs directly. App Mesh doesn't handle scaling."
