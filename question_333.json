  "question": "A company's application runs on Amazon EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB). The instances run in an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group across multiple Availability Zones. On the first day of every month at midnight, the application becomes much slower when the month-end financial calculation batch runs. This causes the CPU utilization of the EC2 instances to immediately peak to 100%, which disrupts the application.\n\nWhat should a solutions architect recommend to ensure the application is able to handle the workload and avoid downtime?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Configure an Amazon CloudFront distribution in front of the ALB.",
    "B": "Configure an EC2 Auto Scaling simple scaling policy based on CPU utilization.",
    "C": "Configure an EC2 Auto Scaling scheduled scaling policy based on the monthly schedule.",
    "D": "Configure Amazon ElastiCache to remove some of the workload from the EC2 instances."
  },
  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": "Scheduled scaling pre-provisions capacity at a known time (first of each month at midnight). This prevents the CPU spike by having instances ready before the batch runs. Simple scaling reacts after CPU spikes, causing delays. CloudFront doesn't help with batch processing. ElastiCache caches data but doesn't address compute-intensive batch jobs."
