  },
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": "Application Load Balancer with AWS Load Balancer Controller provides path-based routing to route requests to different microservices. ALB is more cost-effective than API Gateway for this use case and provides Layer 7 routing capabilities needed for microservices."
