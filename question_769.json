  "question": "A company hosts an application used to upload files to an Amazon S3 bucket. Once uploaded, the files are processed to extract metadata, which takes less than 5 seconds. The volume and frequency of the uploads varies from a few files each hour to hundreds of concurrent uploads. The company has asked a solutions architect to design a cost-effective architecture that will meet these requirements.\n\nWhat should the solutions architect recommend?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Configure AWS CloudTrail trails to log S3 API calls. Use AWS AppSync to process the files.",
    "B": "Configure an object-created event notification within the S3 bucket to invoke an AWS Lambda function to process the files.",
    "C": "Configure Amazon Kinesis Data Streams to process and send data to Amazon S3. Invoke an AWS Lambda function to process the files.",
    "D": "Configure an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic to process the files uploaded to Amazon S3. Invoke an AWS Lambda function to process the files."
  },
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": "S3 Event Notifications can trigger Lambda functions when objects are created. Lambda scales automatically with the number of concurrent uploads, charges only for execution time, and is ideal for short processing tasks (under 5 seconds). This is the most cost-effective and straightforward solution."
