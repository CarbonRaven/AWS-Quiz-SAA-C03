  "question": "A company maintains about 300 TB in Amazon S3 Standard storage month after month. The S3 objects are each typically around 50 GB in size and are frequently replaced with multipart uploads. The number and size of S3 objects remain constant, but the company's S3 storage costs are increasing each month.\n\nHow should a solutions architect reduce costs in this situation?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Switch from multipart uploads to Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration.",
    "B": "Enable an S3 Lifecycle policy that deletes incomplete multipart uploads.",
    "C": "Configure S3 inventory to prevent objects from being archived too quickly.",
    "D": "Configure Amazon CloudFront to reduce the number of objects stored in Amazon S3."
  },
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": "Incomplete multipart uploads accumulate and incur storage charges. An S3 Lifecycle policy to abort incomplete multipart uploads after a specified number of days prevents these partial uploads from consuming storage and increasing costs."
}
