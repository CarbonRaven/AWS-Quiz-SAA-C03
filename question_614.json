  "options": {
    "A": "Deploy AWS PrivateLink in front of the application servers. Configure the network ACL to allow only the web servers to access the application servers.",
    "B": "Deploy a VPC endpoint in front of the application servers. Configure the security group to allow only the web servers to access the application servers.",
    "C": "Deploy a Network Load Balancer with a target group that contains the application servers' Auto Scaling group. Configure the network ACL to allow only the web servers to access the application servers.",
    "D": "Deploy an Application Load Balancer with a target group that contains the application servers' Auto Scaling group. Configure the security group to allow only the web servers to access the application servers."
  },
