  "options": {
    "A": "Create Amazon RDS automated backups. Set the retention period to 90 days.",
    "B": "Create an Amazon RDS manual snapshot every day. Delete manual snapshots that are older than 90 days.",
    "C": "Use the Amazon Aurora Clone feature for Oracle to create a point-in-time restore. Delete clones that are older than 90 days.",
    "D": "Create a backup plan that has a retention period of 90 days by using AWS Backup for Amazon RDS."
  },
