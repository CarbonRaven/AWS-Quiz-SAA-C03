  "question": "A medical research lab produces data that is related to a new study. The lab wants to make the data available with minimum latency to clinics across the country for their on-premises, file-based applications. The data files are stored in an Amazon S3 bucket that has read-only permissions for each clinic.\nWhat should a solutions architect recommend to meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Deploy an AWS Storage Gateway file gateway as a virtual machine (VM) on premises at each clinic.",
    "B": "Migrate the files to each clinic's on-premises applications by using AWS DataSync for processing.",
    "C": "Deploy an AWS Storage Gateway volume gateway as a virtual machine (VM) on premises at each clinic.",
    "D": "Attach an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file system to each clinic's on-premises servers."
  },
  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": "File Gateway provides a file interface (NFS/SMB) to S3, enabling on-premises file-based applications to access S3 data with local caching for low latency. It's ideal for extending S3 to on-premises locations. Volume Gateway provides block storage, not file access."
