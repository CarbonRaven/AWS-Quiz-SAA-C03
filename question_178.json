  "question": "A company's infrastructure consists of Amazon EC2 instances and an Amazon RDS DB instance in a single AWS Region. The company wants to back up its data in a separate Region.\nWhich solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Use AWS Backup to copy EC2 backups and RDS backups to the separate Region.",
    "B": "Use Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager (Amazon DLM) to copy EC2 backups and RDS backups to the separate Region.",
    "C": "Create Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) of the EC2 instances. Copy the AMIs to the separate Region. Create a read replica for the RDS DB instance in the separate Region.",
    "D": "Create Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) snapshots. Copy the EBS snapshots to the separate Region. Create RDS snapshots. Export the RDS snapshots to Amazon S3. Configure S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR) to the separate Region."
  },
  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": "AWS Backup provides a centralized, fully managed backup service that can back up both EC2 and RDS resources and copy them to another region automatically. This has the least operational overhead compared to managing multiple backup mechanisms separately."
}
