  "question": "A company has multiple AWS accounts that use consolidated billing. The company runs several active high performance Amazon RDS for Oracle On-Demand DB instances for 90 days. The company's finance team has access to AWS Trusted Advisor in the consolidated billing account and all other AWS accounts.\n\nThe finance team needs to use the appropriate AWS account to access the Trusted Advisor check recommendations for RDS. The finance team must review the appropriate Trusted Advisor check to reduce RDS costs.\n\nWhich combination of steps should the finance team take to meet these requirements? (Choose two.)",
  "options": {
    "A": "Use the Trusted Advisor recommendations from the account where the RDS instances are running.",
    "B": "Use the Trusted Advisor recommendations from the consolidated billing account to see all RDS instance checks at the same time.",
    "C": "Review the Trusted Advisor check for Amazon RDS Reserved Instance Optimization.",
    "D": "Review the Trusted Advisor check for Amazon RDS Idle DB Instances.",
    "E": "Review the Trusted Advisor check for Amazon Redshift Reserved Node Optimization."
  },
  "correct_answer": ["B", "D"],
  "explanation": "The consolidated billing account (B) provides organization-wide Trusted Advisor recommendations. RDS Idle DB Instances check (D) identifies underutilized instances to reduce costs. Reserved Instance Optimization requires Business/Enterprise support. Redshift is unrelated to RDS."
