  "question": "An ecommerce company runs an application in the AWS Cloud that is integrated with an on-premises warehouse solution. The company uses Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) to send order messages to an on-premises HTTPS endpoint so the warehouse application can process the orders. The local data center team has detected that some of the order messages were not received.\n\nA solutions architect needs to retain messages that are not delivered and analyze the messages for up to 14 days.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST development effort?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Configure an Amazon SNS dead letter queue that has an Amazon Kinesis Data Stream target with a retention period of 14 days.",
    "B": "Add an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue with a retention period of 14 days between the application and Amazon SNS.",
    "C": "Configure an Amazon SNS dead letter queue that has an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) target with a retention period of 14 days.",
    "D": "Configure an Amazon SNS dead letter queue that has an Amazon DynamoDB target with a TTL attribute set for a retention period of 14 days."
  },
  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": "SNS supports dead-letter queues using SQS to capture failed message deliveries. SQS supports message retention up to 14 days. This allows analyzing undelivered messages with minimal development effort. Kinesis and DynamoDB require additional processing logic."
