  "question": "A media company stores movies in Amazon S3. Each movie is stored in a single video file that ranges from 1 GB to 10 GB in size.\n\nThe company must be able to provide the streaming content of a movie within 5 minutes of a user purchase. There is higher demand for movies that are less than 20 years old than for movies that are more than 20 years old. The company wants to minimize hosting service costs based on demand.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Store all media content in Amazon S3. Use S3 Lifecycle policies to move media data into the Infrequent Access tier when the demand for a movie decreases.",
    "B": "Store newer movie video files in S3 Standard. Store older movie video files in S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA). When a user orders an older movie, retrieve the video file by using standard retrieval.",
    "C": "Store newer movie video files in S3 Intelligent-Tiering. Store older movie video files in S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval. When a user orders an older movie, retrieve the video file by using expedited retrieval.",
    "D": "Store newer movie video files in S3 Standard. Store older movie video files in S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval. When a user orders an older movie, retrieve the video file by using bulk retrieval."
  },
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": "S3 Standard-IA provides immediate access with lower storage costs for infrequently accessed data. Since movies must be available within 5 minutes, S3 Standard-IA is appropriate for older movies as it provides instant retrieval. Glacier retrieval times (even expedited) may not consistently meet the 5-minute requirement."
