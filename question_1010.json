  "question": "A company runs multiple workloads on virtual machines (VMs) in an on-premises data center. The company is expanding rapidly. The on-premises data center is not able to scale fast enough to meet business needs. The company wants to migrate the workloads to AWS.\n\nThe migration is time sensitive. The company wants to use a lift-and-shift strategy for non-critical workloads.\n\nWhich combination of steps will meet these requirements? (Choose three.)",
  "options": {
    "A": "Use the AWS Schema Conversion Tool (AWS SCT) to collect data about the VMs.",
    "B": "Use AWS Application Migration Service. Install the AWS Replication Agent on the VMs.",
    "C": "Complete the initial replication of the VMs. Launch test instances to perform acceptance tests on the VMs.",
    "D": "Stop all operations on the VMs. Launch a cutover instance.",
    "E": "Use AWS App2Container (A2C) to collect data about the VMs.",
    "F": "Use AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) to migrate the VMs."
  },
  "correct_answer": ["B", "C", "D"],
  "explanation": "AWS Application Migration Service (MGN) is the correct service for lift-and-shift VM migrations. The process involves: (1) Install Replication Agent on source VMs, (2) Complete initial replication and test with test instances, (3) Perform cutover by stopping source VMs and launching cutover instances. SCT/DMS are for database migrations, and A2C is for containerizing applications."
