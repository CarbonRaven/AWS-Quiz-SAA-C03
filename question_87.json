  "question": "A company hosts an application on AWS Lambda functions that are invoked by an Amazon API Gateway API. The Lambda functions save customer data to an Amazon Aurora MySQL database. Whenever the company upgrades the database, the Lambda functions fail to establish database connections until the upgrade is complete. The result is that customer data is not recorded for some of the events.\nA solutions architect needs to design a solution that stores customer data that is created during database upgrades.\nWhich solution will meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Provision an Amazon RDS proxy to sit between the Lambda functions and the database. Configure the Lambda functions to connect to the RDS proxy.",
    "B": "Increase the run time of the Lambda functions to the maximum. Create a retry mechanism in the code that stores the customer data in the database.",
    "C": "Persist the customer data to Lambda local storage. Configure new Lambda functions to scan the local storage to save the customer data to the database.",
    "D": "Store the customer data in an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) FIFO queue. Create a new Lambda function that polls the queue and stores the customer data in the database."
  },
  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": "SQS FIFO queue provides durable storage for customer data during database downtime. Messages persist until successfully processed, ensuring no data loss. Lambda can process the queue once the database is available."
}
