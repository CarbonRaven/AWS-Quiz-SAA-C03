  "question": "An Amazon EC2 instance is located in a private subnet in a new VPC. This subnet does not have outbound internet access, but the EC2 instance needs the ability to download monthly security updates from an outside vendor.\n\nWhat should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Create an internet gateway, and attach it to the VPC. Configure the private subnet route table to use the internet gateway as the default route.",
    "B": "Create a NAT gateway, and place it in a public subnet. Configure the private subnet route table to use the NAT gateway as the default route.",
    "C": "Create a NAT instance, and place it in the same subnet where the EC2 instance is located. Configure the private subnet route table to use the NAT instance as the default route.",
    "D": "Create an internet gateway, and attach it to the VPC. Create a NAT instance, and place it in the same subnet where the EC2 instance is located. Configure the private subnet route table to use the internet gateway as the default route."
  },
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": "NAT gateway in a public subnet allows private subnet instances to access the internet for outbound traffic (like security updates) while remaining private. The private subnet route table points to the NAT gateway for 0.0.0.0/0. NAT instances in the same private subnet wouldn't work - they need to be in a public subnet with internet gateway access."
