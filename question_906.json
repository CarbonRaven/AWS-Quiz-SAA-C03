  "question": "A company runs a self-managed Microsoft SQL Server on Amazon EC2 instances and Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS). Daily snapshots are taken of the EBS volumes.\n\nRecently, all the company's EBS snapshots were accidentally deleted while running a snapshot cleaning script that deletes all expired EBS snapshots. A solutions architect needs to update the architecture to prevent data loss without retaining EBS snapshots indefinitely.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST development effort?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Change the IAM policy of the user to deny EBS snapshot deletion.",
    "B": "Copy the EBS snapshots to another AWS Region after completing the snapshots daily.",
    "C": "Create a 7-day EBS snapshot retention rule in Recycle Bin and apply the rule for all snapshots.",
    "D": "Copy EBS snapshots to Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA)."
  },
  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": "Amazon EBS Recycle Bin allows you to retain deleted EBS snapshots for a specified period, protecting against accidental deletion. This requires the least development effort compared to other solutions."
