  "question": "A company uses Amazon S3 to store high-resolution pictures in an S3 bucket. The company stores the pictures as the latest version of an S3 object. The company needs to retain only the two most recent versions of the pictures.\n\nThe company wants to reduce costs. The company has identified the S3 bucket as a large expense.\n\nWhich solution will reduce the S3 costs with the LEAST operational overhead?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Use S3 Lifecycle to delete expired object versions and retain the two most recent versions.",
    "B": "Use an AWS Lambda function to check for older versions and delete all but the two most recent versions.",
    "C": "Use S3 Batch Operations to delete noncurrent object versions and retain only the two most recent versions.",
    "D": "Deactivate versioning on the S3 bucket and retain the two most recent versions."
  },
  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": "S3 Lifecycle policies can automatically expire noncurrent object versions, keeping only a specified number of recent versions. This is a built-in feature with no operational overhead. Lambda functions and Batch Operations require additional management. Deactivating versioning doesn't clean up existing versions."
}
