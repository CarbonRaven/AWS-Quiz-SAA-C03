  "question": "A company runs a highly available SFTP service. The SFTP service uses two Amazon EC2 Linux instances that run with elastic IP addresses to accept traffic from trusted IP sources on the internet. The SFTP service is backed by shared storage that is attached to the instances. User accounts are created and managed as Linux users in the SFTP servers.\n\nThe company wants a serverless option that provides high IOPS performance and highly configurable security. The company also wants to maintain control over user permissions.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Create an encrypted Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume. Create an AWS Transfer Family SFTP service with a public endpoint that allows only trusted IP addresses. Attach the EBS volume to the SFTP service endpoint. Grant users access to the SFTP service.",
    "B": "Create an encrypted Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) volume. Create an AWS Transfer Family SFTP service with elastic IP addresses and a VPC endpoint that has internet-facing access. Attach a security group to the endpoint that allows only trusted IP addresses. Attach the EFS volume to the SFTP service endpoint. Grant users access to the SFTP service.",
    "C": "Create an Amazon S3 bucket with default encryption enabled. Create an AWS Transfer Family SFTP service with a public endpoint that allows only trusted IP addresses. Attach the S3 bucket to the SFTP service endpoint. Grant users access to the SFTP service.",
    "D": "Create an Amazon S3 bucket with default encryption enabled. Create an AWS Transfer Family SFTP service with a VPC endpoint that has internal access in a private subnet. Attach a security group that allows only trusted IP addresses. Attach the S3 bucket to the SFTP service endpoint. Grant users access to the SFTP service."
  },
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": "AWS Transfer Family with EFS provides serverless SFTP with high IOPS file system storage. VPC endpoint with elastic IPs allows internet access while security groups restrict to trusted IPs. EFS provides high performance shared storage. EBS can't be shared across instances. S3 doesn't provide IOPS performance metrics. Internal VPC endpoint isn't accessible from internet."
