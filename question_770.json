  "question": "A company's application is deployed on Amazon EC2 instances and uses AWS Lambda functions for an event-driven architecture. The company uses nonproduction development environments in a different AWS account to test new features before the company deploys the features to production.\n\nThe production instances show constant usage because of customers in different time zones. The company uses nonproduction instances only during business hours on weekdays. The company does not use the nonproduction instances on the weekends. The company wants to optimize the costs to run its application on AWS.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Use On-Demand Instances for the production instances. Use Dedicated Hosts for the nonproduction instances on weekends only.",
    "B": "Use Reserved Instances for the production instances and the nonproduction instances. Shut down the nonproduction instances when not in use.",
    "C": "Use Compute Savings Plans for the production instances. Use On-Demand Instances for the nonproduction instances. Shut down the nonproduction instances when not in use.",
    "D": "Use Dedicated Hosts for the production instances. Use EC2 Instance Savings Plans for the nonproduction instances."
  },
  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": "Compute Savings Plans provide significant discounts for consistent production usage. For nonproduction instances used only during business hours on weekdays, On-Demand is appropriate when combined with shutting down instances when not in use. Reserved Instances for nonproduction would waste money during non-business hours."
