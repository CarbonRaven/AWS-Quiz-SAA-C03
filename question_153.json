  "question": "A company sells ringtones created from clips of popular songs. The files containing the ringtones are stored in Amazon S3 Standard and are at least 128 KB in size. The company has millions of files, but downloads are infrequent for ringtones older than 90 days. The company needs to save money on storage while keeping the most accessed files readily available for its users.\nWhich action should the company take to meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Configure S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) storage for the initial storage tier of the objects.",
    "B": "Move the files to S3 Intelligent-Tiering and configure it to move objects to a less expensive storage tier after 90 days.",
    "C": "Configure S3 inventory to manage objects and move them to S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) after 90 days.",
    "D": "Implement an S3 Lifecycle policy that moves the objects from S3 Standard to S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) after 90 days."
  },
  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": "S3 Lifecycle policies automate transitioning objects to cheaper storage classes based on age. Since access patterns are predictable (infrequent after 90 days), a lifecycle policy to S3 Standard-IA is more cost-effective than Intelligent-Tiering, which has monitoring fees."
