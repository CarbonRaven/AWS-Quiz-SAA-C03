  "question": "A company is preparing to deploy a new serverless workload. A solutions architect must use the principle of least privilege to configure permissions that will be used to run an AWS Lambda function. An Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule will invoke the function.\nWhich solution meets these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Add an execution role to the function with lambda:InvokeFunction as the action and * as the principal.",
    "B": "Add an execution role to the function with lambda:InvokeFunction as the action and Service: lambda.amazonaws.com as the principal.",
    "C": "Add a resource-based policy to the function with lambda:* as the action and Service: events.amazonaws.com as the principal.",
    "D": "Add a resource-based policy to the function with lambda:InvokeFunction as the action and Service: events.amazonaws.com as the principal."
  },
  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": "Resource-based policies allow other services to invoke Lambda. EventBridge needs lambda:InvokeFunction permission (least privilege, not lambda:*) with events.amazonaws.com as principal."
}
