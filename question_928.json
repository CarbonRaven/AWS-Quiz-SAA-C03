  "question": "A company hosts a video streaming web application in a VPC. The company uses a Network Load Balancer (NLB) to handle TCP traffic for real-time data processing. There have been unauthorized attempts to access the application.\n\nThe company wants to improve application security with minimal architectural change to prevent unauthorized attempts to access the application.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Implement a series of AWS WAF rules directly on the NLB to filter out unauthorized traffic.",
    "B": "Recreate the NLB with a security group to allow only trusted IP addresses.",
    "C": "Deploy a second NLB in parallel with the existing NLB configured with a strict IP address allow list.",
    "D": "Use AWS Shield Advanced to provide enhanced DDoS protection and prevent unauthorized access attempts."
  },
  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": "AWS Shield Advanced provides enhanced DDoS protection and works with NLB. WAF cannot be attached directly to NLB. Shield Advanced provides protection with minimal architectural changes."
}
