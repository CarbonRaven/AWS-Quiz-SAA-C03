  "question": "A company uses AWS to run its ecommerce platform. The platform is critical to the company's operations and has a high volume of traffic and transactions. The company configures a multi-factor authentication (MFA) device to secure its AWS account root user credentials. The company wants to ensure that it will not lose access to the root user account if the MFA device is lost.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Set up a backup administrator account that the company can use to log in if the company loses the MFA device.",
    "B": "Add multiple MFA devices for the root user account to handle the disaster scenario.",
    "C": "Create a new administrator account when the company cannot access the root account.",
    "D": "Attach the administrator policy to another IAM user when the company cannot access the root account."
  },
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": "AWS allows registering multiple MFA devices (up to 8) for the root user account. This provides redundancy in case one MFA device is lost or damaged. Having backup MFA devices is the proper way to prevent losing root account access while maintaining security."
