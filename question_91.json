  "question": "A company has applications that run on Amazon EC2 instances in a VPC. One of the applications needs to call the Amazon S3 API to store and read objects. According to the company's security regulations, no traffic from the applications is allowed to travel across the internet.\nWhich solution will meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Configure an S3 gateway endpoint.",
    "B": "Create an S3 bucket in a private subnet.",
    "C": "Create an S3 bucket in the same AWS Region as the EC2 instances.",
    "D": "Configure a NAT gateway in the same subnet as the EC2 instances."
  },
  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": "S3 gateway endpoints provide private connectivity to S3 without traversing the internet. Traffic stays within the AWS network. NAT gateway routes traffic through the internet."
}
