  "question": "A company uses AWS Cost Explorer to monitor its AWS costs. The company notices that Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) storage and snapshot costs increase every month. However, the company does not purchase additional EBS storage every month. The company wants to optimize monthly costs for its current storage usage.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Use logs in Amazon CloudWatch Logs to monitor the storage utilization of Amazon EBS. Use Amazon EBS Elastic Volumes to reduce the size of the EBS volumes.",
    "B": "Use a custom script to monitor space usage. Use Amazon EBS Elastic Volumes to reduce the size of the EBS volumes.",
    "C": "Delete all expired and unused snapshots to reduce snapshot costs.",
    "D": "Delete all nonessential snapshots. Use Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager to create and manage the snapshots according to the company's snapshot policy requirements."
  },
  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": "Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager automates the creation, retention, and deletion of EBS snapshots according to defined policies. This prevents snapshot accumulation and manages costs with minimal operational overhead by automatically cleaning up old snapshots."
}
