  "question": "A company is building an application that consists of several microservices. The company has decided to use container technologies to deploy its software on AWS. The company needs a solution that minimizes the amount of ongoing effort for maintenance and scaling. The company cannot manage additional infrastructure.\n\nWhich combination of actions should a solutions architect take to meet these requirements? (Choose two.)",
  "options": {
    "A": "Deploy an Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) cluster.",
    "B": "Deploy the Kubernetes control plane on Amazon EC2 instances that span multiple Availability Zones.",
    "C": "Deploy an Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) service with an Amazon EC2 launch type. Specify a desired task number level of greater than or equal to 2.",
    "D": "Deploy an Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) service with a Fargate launch type. Specify a desired task number level of greater than or equal to 2.",
    "E": "Deploy Kubernetes worker nodes on Amazon EC2 instances that span multiple Availability Zones. Create a deployment that specifies two or more replicas for each microservice."
  },
  "correct_answer": ["A", "D"],
  "explanation": "ECS cluster (A) is required to run ECS services. Fargate launch type (D) is serverless - no infrastructure to manage, automatic scaling, and the desired task count of 2+ ensures high availability. EC2 launch type requires managing EC2 instances. Self-managed Kubernetes on EC2 requires significant infrastructure management."
