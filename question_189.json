  "question": "A company needs to store contract documents. A contract lasts for 5 years. During the 5-year period, the company must ensure that the documents cannot be overwritten or deleted. The company needs to encrypt the documents at rest and rotate the encryption keys automatically every year.\nWhich combination of steps should a solutions architect take to meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead? (Choose two.)",
  "options": {
    "A": "Store the documents in Amazon S3. Use S3 Object Lock in governance mode.",
    "B": "Store the documents in Amazon S3. Use S3 Object Lock in compliance mode.",
    "C": "Use server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed encryption keys (SSE-S3). Configure key rotation.",
    "D": "Use server-side encryption with AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer managed keys. Configure key rotation.",
    "E": "Use server-side encryption with AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer provided (imported) keys. Configure key rotation."
  },
  "correct_answer": ["B", "D"],
  "explanation": "S3 Object Lock in compliance mode prevents anyone from deleting or overwriting objects for the retention period (5 years). KMS customer managed keys support automatic annual key rotation. SSE-S3 doesn't support configurable rotation. Governance mode can be overridden by privileged users."
