  "question": "A global ecommerce company runs its critical workloads on AWS. The workloads use an Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance that is configured for a Multi-AZ deployment.\n\nCustomers have reported application timeouts when the company undergoes database failovers. The company needs a resilient solution to reduce failover time.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Create an Amazon RDS Proxy. Assign the proxy to the DB instance.",
    "B": "Create a read replica for the DB instance. Move the read traffic to the read replica.",
    "C": "Enable Performance Insights. Monitor the CPU load to identify the timeouts.",
    "D": "Take regular automatic snapshots. Copy the automatic snapshots to multiple AWS Regions."
  },
  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": "RDS Proxy maintains a pool of database connections and handles failover transparently, reducing failover time from minutes to seconds. It manages connection multiplexing and failover, preventing application timeouts during database failovers."
