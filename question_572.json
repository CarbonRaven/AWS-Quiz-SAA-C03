  "question": "A company runs an application on AWS. The application receives inconsistent amounts of usage. The application uses AWS Direct Connect to connect to an on-premises MySQL-compatible database. The on-premises database consistently uses a minimum of 2 GiB of memory.\n\nThe company wants to migrate the on-premises database to a managed AWS service. The company wants to use auto scaling capabilities to manage unexpected workload increases.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST administrative overhead?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Provision an Amazon DynamoDB database with default read and write capacity settings.",
    "B": "Provision an Amazon Aurora database with a minimum capacity of 1 Aurora capacity unit (ACU).",
    "C": "Provision an Amazon Aurora Serverless v2 database with a minimum capacity of 1 Aurora capacity unit (ACU).",
    "D": "Provision an Amazon RDS for MySQL database with 2 GiB of memory."
  },
  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": "Aurora Serverless v2 is MySQL-compatible, auto-scales based on demand, and is a managed service with minimal administrative overhead. It can scale from 0.5 ACU up to 128 ACUs based on workload. DynamoDB is not MySQL-compatible."
