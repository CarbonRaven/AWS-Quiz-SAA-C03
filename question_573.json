  "question": "A company wants to use an event-driven programming model with AWS Lambda. The company wants to reduce startup latency for Lambda functions that run on Java 11. The company does not have strict latency requirements for the applications. The company wants to reduce cold starts and outlier latencies when a function scales up.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Configure Lambda provisioned concurrency.",
    "B": "Increase the timeout of the Lambda functions.",
    "C": "Increase the memory of the Lambda functions.",
    "D": "Configure Lambda SnapStart."
  },
  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": "Lambda SnapStart is designed specifically for Java functions to reduce cold start latency. It creates a snapshot of the initialized execution environment. It's more cost-effective than provisioned concurrency as there's no additional charge for SnapStart."
}
