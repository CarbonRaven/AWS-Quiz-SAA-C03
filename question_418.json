  "question": "A solutions architect needs to allow team members to access Amazon S3 buckets in two different AWS accounts: a development account and a production account. The team currently has access to S3 buckets in the development account by using unique IAM users that are assigned to an IAM group that has appropriate permissions in the account.\n\nThe solutions architect has created an IAM role in the production account. The role has a policy that grants access to an S3 bucket in the production account.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements while complying with the principle of least privilege?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Attach the Administrator Access policy to the development account users.",
    "B": "Add the development account as a principal in the trust policy of the role in the production account.",
    "C": "Turn off the S3 Block Public Access feature on the S3 bucket in the production account.",
    "D": "Create a user in the production account with unique credentials for each team member."
  },
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": "Adding the development account as a trusted principal allows users to assume the role in the production account. This follows least privilege by granting only the permissions defined in the role. Administrator Access is over-permissive. Disabling Block Public Access exposes data. Creating duplicate users doesn't follow least privilege and increases management overhead."
