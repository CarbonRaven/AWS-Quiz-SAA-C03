  "question": "A solutions architect is designing an asynchronous application to process credit card data validation requests for a bank. The application must be secure and be able to process each request at least once.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Use AWS Lambda event source mapping. Set Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) standard queues as the event source. Use AWS Key Management Service (SSE-KMS) for encryption. Add the kms:Decrypt permission for the Lambda execution role.",
    "B": "Use AWS Lambda event source mapping. Use Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) FIFO queues as the event source. Use SQS managed encryption keys (SSE-SQS) for encryption. Add the encryption key invocation permission for the Lambda function.",
    "C": "Use the AWS Lambda event source mapping. Set Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) FIFO queues as the event source. Use AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS). Add the kms:Decrypt permission for the Lambda execution role.",
    "D": "Use the AWS Lambda event source mapping. Set Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) standard queues as the event source. Use AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS) for encryption. Add the encryption key invocation permission for the Lambda function."
  },
  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": "SQS standard queues with Lambda event source mapping provide at-least-once processing. SSE-KMS provides secure encryption for credit card data. kms:Decrypt permission is needed for Lambda to read encrypted messages. Standard queues are more cost-effective than FIFO when exactly-once isn't required."
