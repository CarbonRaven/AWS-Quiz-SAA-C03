  "question": "To meet security requirements, a company needs to encrypt all of its application data in transit while communicating with an Amazon RDS MySQL DB instance. A recent security audit revealed that encryption at rest is enabled using AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS), but data in transit is not enabled.\n\nWhat should a solutions architect do to satisfy the security requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Enable IAM database authentication on the database.",
    "B": "Provide self-signed certificates. Use the certificates in all connections to the RDS instance.",
    "C": "Take a snapshot of the RDS instance. Restore the snapshot to a new instance with encryption enabled.",
    "D": "Download AWS-provided root certificates. Provide the certificates in all connections to the RDS instance."
  },
  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": "To enable encryption in transit for RDS MySQL, applications must use SSL/TLS connections with the AWS-provided root certificates. AWS provides CA certificates that applications use to verify the RDS instance and establish encrypted connections."
}
