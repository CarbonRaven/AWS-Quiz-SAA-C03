    "B": "Create a script that scans the DynamoDB table and uses Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) to send email messages to employees when necessary. Use a cron job to run this script every day on an Amazon EC2 instance.",
    "C": "Create an AWS Lambda function that scans the DynamoDB table and uses Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) to send email messages to employees when necessary. Schedule this Lambda function to run every day.",
    "D": "Create an AWS Lambda function that scans the DynamoDB table and uses Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) to send email messages to employees when necessary. Schedule this Lambda function to run every day."
