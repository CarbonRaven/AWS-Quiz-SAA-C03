  "question": "A company wants to move its application to a serverless solution. The serverless solution needs to analyze existing and new data by using SQL. The company stores the data in an Amazon S3 bucket. The data requires encryption and must be replicated to a different AWS Region.\nWhich solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Create a new S3 bucket. Load the data into the new S3 bucket. Use S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR) to replicate encrypted objects to an S3 bucket in another Region. Use server-side encryption with AWS KMS multi-Region keys (SSE-KMS). Use Amazon Athena to query the data.",
    "B": "Create a new S3 bucket. Load the data into the new S3 bucket. Use S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR) to replicate encrypted objects to an S3 bucket in another Region. Use server-side encryption with AWS KMS multi-Region keys (SSE-KMS). Use Amazon RDS to query the data.",
    "C": "Load the data into the existing S3 bucket. Use S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR) to replicate encrypted objects to an S3 bucket in another Region. Use server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed encryption keys (SSE-S3). Use Amazon Athena to query the data.",
    "D": "Load the data into the existing S3 bucket. Use S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR) to replicate encrypted objects to an S3 bucket in another Region. Use server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed encryption keys (SSE-S3). Use Amazon RDS to query the data."
  },
  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": "Using the existing S3 bucket reduces overhead. SSE-S3 is simpler than SSE-KMS (no key management). Athena is serverless and queries S3 directly using SQL. RDS is not serverless and requires provisioning. This combination provides least operational overhead."
