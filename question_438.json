  "question": "A company wants to share accounting data with an external auditor. The data is stored in an Amazon RDS DB instance that resides in a private subnet. The auditor has its own AWS account and requires its own copy of the database.\n\nWhat is the MOST secure way for the company to share the database with the auditor?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Create a read replica of the database. Configure IAM standard database authentication to grant the auditor access.",
    "B": "Export the database contents to text files. Store the files in an Amazon S3 bucket. Create a new IAM user for the auditor. Grant the user access to the S3 bucket.",
    "C": "Copy a snapshot of the database to an Amazon S3 bucket. Create an IAM user. Share the user's keys with the auditor to grant access to the object in the S3 bucket.",
    "D": "Create an encrypted snapshot of the database. Share the snapshot with the auditor. Allow access to the AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) encryption key."
  },
  "correct_answer": "D",
  "explanation": "Sharing an encrypted RDS snapshot with the auditor's AWS account is secure - data stays encrypted in transit and at rest. KMS key sharing allows decryption. The auditor gets their own copy in their account. Read replica gives direct database access (security risk). Text export loses database structure. Sharing IAM credentials is a security anti-pattern."
