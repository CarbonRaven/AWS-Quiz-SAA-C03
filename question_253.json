  "question": "A solutions architect has created two IAM policies: Policy1 and Policy2. Both policies are attached to an IAM group.\n\nPolicy1 (Allow):\n- Actions: iam:Get*, iam:List*, kms:List*, ec2:*, ds:*, logs:Get*, logs:Describe*\n- Resource: *\n\nPolicy2 (Deny):\n- Action: ds:Delete*\n- Resource: *\n\nA cloud engineer is added as an IAM user to the IAM group. Which action will the cloud engineer be able to perform?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Deleting IAM users",
    "B": "Deleting directories",
    "C": "Deleting Amazon EC2 instances",
    "D": "Deleting logs from Amazon CloudWatch Logs"
  },
  "correct_answer": "C",
  "explanation": "Policy1 allows ec2:* which includes EC2 instance deletion. Policy2 explicitly denies ds:Delete* (Directory Service delete operations), blocking directory deletion. IAM users can't be deleted because only iam:Get* and iam:List* are allowed (no iam:Delete*). CloudWatch logs deletion requires logs:Delete* which isn't allowed. Explicit deny always overrides allow, so ds:Delete* is blocked despite ds:* being allowed in Policy1."
