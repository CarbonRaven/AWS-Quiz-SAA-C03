  "question": "A company is building a three-tier application on AWS. The presentation tier will serve a static website. The logic tier is a containerized application. This application will store data in a relational database. The company wants to simplify deployment and to reduce operational costs.\n\nWhich solution will meet these requirements?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Use Amazon S3 to host static content. Use Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) with AWS Fargate for compute power. Use a managed Amazon RDS cluster for the database.",
    "B": "Use Amazon CloudFront to host static content. Use Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) with Amazon EC2 for compute power. Use a managed Amazon RDS cluster for the database.",
    "C": "Use Amazon S3 to host static content. Use Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) with AWS Fargate for compute power. Use a managed Amazon RDS cluster for the database.",
    "D": "Use Amazon EC2 Reserved Instances to host static content. Use Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) with Amazon EC2 for compute power. Use a managed Amazon RDS cluster for the database."
  },
  "correct_answer": "A",
  "explanation": "S3 is the simplest and most cost-effective for static website hosting. ECS with Fargate provides serverless container orchestration with reduced operational overhead compared to EKS or EC2. RDS provides managed database. This combination simplifies deployment and reduces operational costs."
