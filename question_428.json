  "question": "A serverless application uses Amazon API Gateway, AWS Lambda, and Amazon DynamoDB. The Lambda function needs permissions to read and write to the DynamoDB table.\n\nWhich solution will give the Lambda function access to the DynamoDB table MOST securely?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Create an IAM user with programmatic access to the Lambda function. Attach a policy to the user that allows read and write access to the DynamoDB table. Store the access_key_id and secret_access_key parameters as part of the Lambda environment variables. Ensure that other AWS users do not have read and write access to the Lambda function configuration.",
    "B": "Create an IAM role that includes Lambda as a trusted service. Attach a policy to the role that allows read and write access to the DynamoDB table. Update the configuration of the Lambda function to use the new role as the execution role.",
    "C": "Create an IAM user with programmatic access to the Lambda function. Attach a policy to the user that allows read and write access to the DynamoDB table. Store the access_key_id and secret_access_key parameters in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store as secure string parameters. Update the Lambda function code to retrieve the secure string parameters before connecting to the DynamoDB table.",
    "D": "Create an IAM role that includes DynamoDB as a trusted service. Attach a policy to the role that allows read and write access from the Lambda function. Update the code of the Lambda function to attach to the new role as an execution role."
  },
  "correct_answer": "B",
  "explanation": "IAM execution role is the most secure way for Lambda to access AWS services. Lambda assumes the role automatically without credentials in code or environment variables. Storing credentials (even in Parameter Store) is less secure than using IAM roles. DynamoDB can't be a trusted service in a role for Lambda access."
